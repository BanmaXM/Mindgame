Concede their strong battlefield and use your evenly distributed forces (e.g., `[A7 B7 C6]`) to easily win the other two.\n\n2.  **If the opponent usually played a `Two-Front Push` (e.g., [A10 B10 C0]):**\n    * Deploy a **One-Front Push**. Overwhelm one of their two strong battlefields with a massive force (e.g., 12-15 troops) and use a minimal force to capture their weakest battlefield, conceding their other strong front.\n\n3.  **If the opponent played a `Balanced` strategy (e.g., [A7 B7 C6]):**\n    * Deploy a **Two-Front Push**. Concentrate your forces (e.g., 9-11 troops each) to decisively win two battlefields, completely sacrificing the third (0-2 troops).\n\n### Execution Rules\n\n*   **Round 1:** Using an opening two-front push, sacrificing one field such as [A10 B0 C10].\n*   **Maintain Tactical Flexibility:** Always vary the exact troop counts and battlefield assignments (A, B, C) within your chosen strategy to avoid becoming predictable.\n*   **Adapt Every Round:** Continuously analyze and counter.\n\n## Output Format (Strict)\n- `[Ax By Cz]`\n- `x, y, z` must be ≥ 0  \n- `x + y + z = 20`  \n- **Your final line of output must be a single line in the format `[Ax By Cz]`.**\n- **Don't ignore the 0.**",

This approach is based on a \"rock-paper-scissors\" dynamic where each primary strategy has a specific counter.\n\n### Tactical Archetypes & Counters\n\n1.  **If the opponent usually played a `One-Front Push` (e.g., [A14 B3 C3]):**\n    * Deploy a **Balanced** strategy. Concede their strong battlefield and use your evenly distributed forces (e.g., `[A7 B7 C6]`) to easily win the other two.\n\n2.  **If the opponent usually played a `Two-Front Push` (e.g., [A10 B10 C0]):**\n    * Deploy a **One-Front Push**. Overwhelm one of their two strong battlefields with a massive force (e.g., 12-15 troops) and use a minimal force to capture their weakest battlefield, conceding their other strong front.\n\n3.  **If the opponent played a `Balanced` strategy (e.g., [A7 B7 C6]):**\n    * Deploy a **Two-Front Push**. Concentrate your forces (e.g., 9-11 troops each) to decisively win two battlefields, completely sacrificing the third (0-2 troops).\n\n### Execution Rules\n\n*   **Round 1:** Using an opening two-front push, sacrificing one field such as [A10 B0 C10].\n*   **Maintain Tactical Flexibility:** Always vary the exact troop counts and battlefield assignments (A, B, C) within your chosen strategy to avoid becoming predictable.\n*   **Adapt Every Round:** Continuously analyze and counter.\n\n## Output Format (Strict)\n- `[Ax By Cz]`\n- `x, y, z` must be ≥ 0  \n- `x + y + z = 20`  \n- **Your final line of output must be a single line in the format `[Ax By Cz]`.**\n- **Don't ignore the 0.**",

Concede their strong battlefield and use your evenly distributed forces (e.g., `[A7 B7 C6]`) to easily win the other two.\n\n2.  **If the opponent usually played a `Two-Front Push` (e.g., [A10 B10 C0]):**\n    * Deploy a **One-Front Push**. Overwhelm one of their two strong battlefields with a massive force (e.g., 12-15 troops) and use a minimal force to capture their weakest battlefield, conceding their other strong front.\n\n3.  **If the opponent played a `Balanced` strategy (e.g., [A7 B7 C6]):**\n    * Deploy a **Two-Front Push**. Concentrate your forces (e.g., 9-11 troops each) to decisively win two battlefields, completely sacrificing the third (0-2 troops).\n\n### Execution Rules\n\n*   **Round 1:** Using an opening two-front push, sacrificing one field such as [A10 B0 C10].\n*   **Maintain Tactical Flexibility:** Always vary the exact troop counts and battlefield assignments (A, B, C) within your chosen strategy to avoid becoming predictable.\n*   **Adapt Every Round:** Continuously analyze and counter.\n\n## Output Format (Strict)\n- `[Ax By Cz]`\n- `x, y, z` must be ≥ 0  \n- `x + y + z = 20`  \n- **Your final line of output must be a single line in the format `[Ax By Cz]`.**\n- **Don't ignore the 0.**",

This approach is based on a \"rock-paper-scissors\" dynamic where each primary strategy has a specific counter.\n\n### Tactical Archetypes & Counters\n\n1.  **If the opponent usually played a `One-Front Push` (e.g., [A14 B3 C3]):**\n    * Deploy a **Balanced** strategy. Concede their strong battlefield and use your evenly distributed forces (e.g., `[A7 B7 C6]`) to easily win the other two.\n\n2.  **If the opponent usually played a `Two-Front Push` (e.g., [A10 B10 C0]):**\n    * Deploy a **One-Front Push**. Overwhelm one of their two strong battlefields with a massive force (e.g., 12-15 troops) and use a minimal force to capture their weakest battlefield, conceding their other strong front.\n\n3.  **If the opponent played a `Balanced` strategy (e.g., [A7 B7 C6]):**\n    * Deploy a **Two-Front Push**. Concentrate your forces (e.g., 9-11 troops each) to decisively win two battlefields, completely sacrificing the third (0-2 troops).\n\n### Execution Rules\n\n*   **Round 1:** Using an opening two-front push, sacrificing one field such as [A10 B0 C10].\n*   **Maintain Tactical Flexibility:** Always vary the exact troop counts and battlefield assignments (A, B, C) within your chosen strategy to avoid becoming predictable.\n*   **Adapt Every Round:** Continuously analyze and counter.\n\n## Output Format (Strict)\n- `[Ax By Cz]`\n- `x, y, z` must be ≥ 0  \n- `x + y + z = 20`  \n- **Your final line of output must be a single line in the format `[Ax By Cz]`.**\n- **Don't ignore the 0.**",

Think about your strategy inside <think> tags.\n3. After the think block, ONLY respond with your next move in the exact required format.\n4. DO NOT include explanations, commentary, or predictions about future game states.\n5. DO NOT repeat back the game state or board.\n6. Your response should ONLY contain your single action in the required format after the think block.\n\nIMPORTANT: Your final output line must be only the action. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\n# IF the game is 'colonel_blotto', follow this strategy each round\n\n## Goal\nTwo players simultaneously allocate **20** troops across multiple battlefields (A, B, C).  \nYour goal: win two battlefields per round while staying unpredictable.  \n**Only output in the format `[Ax By Cz]`, nothing else.**\n\n\n## Strategy\n\nYour strategy is to identify your opponent's tactical pattern from their previous move and deploy a direct counter-strategy in the current round. This approach is based on a \"rock-paper-scissors\" dynamic where each primary strategy has a specific counter.\n\n### Tactical Archetypes & Counters\n\n1.  **If the opponent usually played a `One-Front Push` (e.g., [A14 B3 C3]):**\n    * Deploy a **Balanced** strategy. Concede their strong battlefield and use your evenly distributed forces (e.g., `[A7 B7 C6]`) to easily win the other two.\n\n2.  **If the opponent usually played a `Two-Front Push` (e.g., [A10 B10 C0]):**\n    * Deploy a **One-Front Push**. Overwhelm one of their two strong battlefields with a massive force (e.g., 12-15 troops) and use a minimal force to capture their weakest battlefield, conceding their other strong front.\n\n3.  **If the opponent played a `Balanced` strategy (e.g., [A7 B7 C6]):**\n    * Deploy a **Two-Front Push**. Concentrate your forces (e.g., 9-11 troops each) to decisively win two battlefields, completely sacrificing the third (0-2 troops).\n\n### Execution Rules\n\n*   **Round 1:** Using an opening two-front push, sacrificing one field such as [A10 B0 C10].\n*   **Maintain Tactical Flexibility:** Always vary the exact troop counts and battlefield assignments (A, B, C) within your chosen strategy to avoid becoming predictable.\n*   **Adapt Every Round:** Continuously analyze and counter.\n\n## Output Format (Strict)\n- `[Ax By Cz]`\n- `x, y, z` must be ≥ 0  \n- `x + y + z = 20`  \n- **Your final line of output must be a single line in the format `[Ax By Cz]`.**\n- **Don't ignore the 0.**",
