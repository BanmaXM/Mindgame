        "reasoning": "**Analyzing game strategy**\n\nI'm working with a simultaneous move game, and I'm trying to allocate resources to outsmart Beta’s likely pattern, which heavily favored A and B in round 1. If Beta repeats their moves, I should focus on beating them in at least two fields. To do that, I need to allocate more than 9 in two fields, which means I’d have to give up on C entirely. However, if I manage 10 each in A and B, that could secure my victory for the round.**Exploring allocation strategies**\n\nI’m considering different allocation strategies to win the game. I could beat one of the heavy fields and C by allocating more than 9 in one heavy field and more than 2 in C. For example, I might try 10 in A and 8 in C, leaving 0 for B. But if I want to beat both A and C, I need to allocate at least 10 to A and 3 to C, while accepting a loss in B. This way, I could win the round.**Considering potential strategies**\n\nI’m analyzing my troop allocation against Beta’s likely moves. My plan sums to 20, which would beat Beta’s typical 9,9,2 strategy, giving me wins in A and C. But if Beta shifts their strategy to allocate more to C, I could lose that advantage. Trying a simple allocation like [A10 B7 C3] seems effective, but another option [A10 B0 C10] could secure wins in A and C, although it leaves B vulnerable. However, a tie isn’t clear in the rules, so I want to avoid that outcome entirely.**Finalizing allocation format**\n\nI believe that picking [A10 B7 C3] is a solid choice since it secures wins in A and C against Beta's 9,9,2 strategy while keeping B at a moderate level. I need to make sure to present it correctly in the required format with spaces and capitals. So, I'll output: [A10 B7 C3]. The total sums to 20, which is perfect. Just need to keep it simple and straightforward—with no extra text.",
