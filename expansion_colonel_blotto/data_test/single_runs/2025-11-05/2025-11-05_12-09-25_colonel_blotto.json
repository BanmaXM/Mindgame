I might replicate a similar approach, possibly securing two fields while sacrificing one. For instance, I could allocate 8 to fields A and B, and 4 to C, which would win against Beta's 7,7,6. However, if Beta shifts his strategy, I need a solid plan. I could also use 8,7,5 for a tie, but winning two fields is my priority. Choosing between options like 9-6-5 or 10-5-5 seems crucial based on Beta's even spread. Avoiding certain distributions is also essential.[A8 B8 C4]",

I have to format the final action correctly as '[A9 B9 C2]' — ensuring the brackets and spaces are just right, following the developer’s instructions.

Typical puzzles often require including my thinking process followed by the action line. However, the developer's instruction states, \"After thinking, output ONLY one line final action: [Ax By Cz].\" So my final output needs to be just that. I’ll confirm that the chosen numbers add up to 20: 9+9+2=20, which is great. The final message, without any extra punctuation, will simply be: [A9 B9 C2].",
