        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to allocate 20 troops across three battlefields: A, B, and C. The goal is to win two out of the three to win the round. Hmm, Colonel Blotto is a game theory problem where you have to distribute limited resources against an opponent, trying to outguess them.\n\nFirst, I should think about common strategies. If both players choose the same distribution, it's a tie for each battlefield, but since we need to win two, maybe I should focus on two fields and leave one weak. But the opponent might do the same. Wait, but I don't know what they'll do. It's simultaneous, so no way to react.\n\nA classic approach is to spread out but maybe overweight two fields. Like 8,7,5. Wait, but maybe they expect that. Another idea is to use a balanced approach, but that might not win two. For example, 7,7,6. But if the opponent does 8,8,4, then they'd win A and B, I win C, so they win the round. So balanced might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go for two fields with higher numbers. Like 10, 9, 1. But if opponent puts 11 in A, then they take A, but I have 9 in B. Wait, but opponent might not go that high. Wait, the total is 20. So maximum someone can put in one field is 20, but that leaves the others at 0. But if I put 20 in A, opponent could put 1 in B and C, but then they win two fields (B and C) if I have 0 there, but wait no—if opponent puts 1 in B and 1 in C, but they only have 20 total. Wait, opponent has to allocate 20 as well. So if I put 20 in A, opponent could put 0 in A, and 10 in B and 10 in C. Then opponent wins B and C, so they win the round. So putting all in one field is bad.\n\nSo maybe the best is to distribute such that two fields are high enough to likely win. Maybe 7,7,6. But let's see. If opponent does 8,8,4, then they win A and B. If opponent does 9,9,2, same. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe 9,6,5. Wait, but how to choose.\n\nAnother thought: in symmetric games like this, mixed strategies are often used, but since it's only one round here (well, first of nine rounds), maybe the player should randomize. But since it's the first round, maybe the opponent is likely to play a balanced strategy. Or maybe they'll try to go heavy on two fields.\n\nWait, maybe the Nash equilibrium for 3 fields and 20 troops... I don't remember exactly, but often it involves splitting into three parts where each is around 20/3 ≈6.66. So maybe 7,7,6. But perhaps varying it a bit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 8,7,5. Let's check: 8+7+5=20. If opponent plays 7,7,6, then I win A (8>7), lose B (7=7? Wait, do ties count as win for either? The problem statement says \"win two battlefields\", so probably a tie on a battlefield means neither wins it. So to win a battlefield, you need strictly more than opponent's allocation there.\n\nSo if I have 8 on A, opponent has 7, I win A. If I have 7 on B, opponent has 7, it's a tie. Then C: I have 5 vs opponent's 6, so I lose C. So I only win A, tie B, lose C: only one win, so lose the round. So that's bad.\n\nHmm, so ties are bad because they don't contribute to winning the majority. So need to have strict majority on two fields.\n\nSo maybe better to have two fields where you have higher numbers, but not too close. Like 9, 8, 3. Then if opponent has 8,7,5, I win A (9>8), win B (8>7), lose C (3<5). So two wins. But if opponent plays 10,7,3, then A: 9<10, B:8>7, C:3=3 (tie), so only one win. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, 10, 6, 4. If opponent plays 9,7,4: A 10>9, B 6<7, C 4=4. So one win, one tie, one loss: only one win. Not enough.\n\nWait, maybe 7, 6, 7. Wait, same as 7,7,6. Let's see opponent plays 8,8,4. Then A:7<8, B:7<8, C:6>4. So only one win. Bad.\n\nHmm. Maybe a better approach is to make two fields high enough that it's hard for opponent to beat both. Like 9, 9, 2. Total 20. Then if opponent plays 10, 8, 2: A:9<10, B:9>8, C:2=2. So only one win. Not good. If opponent plays 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:9>8, C:2<4. Two wins. So that works against that.\n\nBut if opponent plays 10, 10, 0: they win A and B, I win C. So they take the round.\n\nWait, so the problem is that if I put 9,9,2, opponent can put 10,10,0 and beat me. But opponent has to allocate exactly 20, so 10,10,0 is possible.\n\nAlternatively, 8,8,4. Then if opponent plays 9,9,2: I lose A and B, win C. Bad.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe a more balanced approach where all three are somewhat close but two are slightly higher. Like 8,7,5. Wait, sum 20.\n\nAnother angle: Since it's the first round, perhaps the opponent is likely to play a standard distribution. Maybe they'll do something like 7,7,6. So if I play 8,7,5, then against 7,7,6: A:8>7, B:7=7, C:5<6. So I only win A. Not enough.\n\nIf I play 9,7,4: against 7,7,6: A:9>7, B:7=7, C:4<6. Still only one win.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have two fields where I strictly beat their likely numbers. Suppose opponent plays 6,6,8. Then if I play 7,7,6: A:7>6, B:7>6, C:6<8. Two wins. Good.\n\nBut opponent might not play that. It's a guessing game.\n\nAlternatively, use a strategy that covers multiple possibilities. Maybe 10, 5, 5. Then against 9,9,2: A:10>9, B:5<9, C:5>2. Two wins. Against 7,7,6: A:10>7, B:5<7, C:5<6. Only one win. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe 8, 6, 6. Sum 20. Against 7,7,6: A:8>7, B:6<7, C:6=6. One win. Not good.\n\nHmm. Let's think of possible common distributions:\n\n- Equal split: 7,7,6 (since 20 isn't divisible by 3).\n\n- Two high, one low: 9,9,2; 10,8,2; etc.\n\n- One high, two medium: 12,4,4.\n\nBut the key is to win two. So perhaps the optimal play is to have two fields at 8 and one at 4 (8+8+4=20). Let's test against some possibilities.\n\nIf opponent plays 7,7,6: A:8>7, B:8>7, C:4<6. Two wins. Good.\n\nIf opponent plays 9,9,2: A:8<9, B:8<9, C:4>2. One win. Bad.\n\nSo depending on opponent's strategy, it varies.\n\nAlternatively, 7, 8, 5. Wait, sum 20. Against 7,7,6: A:7=7, B:8>7, C:5<6. One win.\n\nNot good. Maybe 9, 6, 5. Against 7,7,6: A:9>7, B:6<7, C:5<6. One win.\n\nHmm. Maybe 10, 7, 3. Against 8,8,4: A:10>8, B:7<8, C:3<4. One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to randomize, but since I have to pick one, maybe go with a distribution that has two fields above 7. Let's say 8,7,5. Wait, but earlier example showed issues.\n\nWait, another thought: In Colonel Blotto with three fields and total n, a common strategy is to use triples where the numbers are as equal as possible but adjusted to win two. For 20, maybe 7,7,6 is common. So to beat that, I need two fields higher than 7 and 7. So 8,8,4. Because 8>7, 8>7, and 4<6. So two wins.\n\nBut if opponent plays 9,9,2, then 8<9 on both A and B, so only win C. So that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a distribution like 9, 8, 3. Against 7,7,6: A:9>7, B:8>7, C:3<6. Two wins. Against 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:8=8, C:3<4. One win and a tie, so only one win. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Maybe 9,7,4. Against 7,7,6: A:9>7, B:7=7, C:4<6. One win. Not good.\n\nWait, perhaps 10, 6, 4. Against 7,7,6: A:10>7, B:6<7, C:4<6. One win. No good.\n\nWhat if I do 7, 8, 5. Against 6,6,8: A:7>6, B:8>6, C:5<8. Two wins. But if opponent does 8,8,4: A:7<8, B:8=8, C:5>4. One win.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe the best bet is to go with 8,8,4 because it beats the common 7,7,6 strategy. Since it's the first round, maybe the opponent is using a balanced approach. So 8,8,4 gives two wins against 7,7,6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 9,7,4. Wait, no.\n\nWait, another angle: If I put 0 in one field, but that's risky. Like 10,10,0. If opponent has any in C, they win it, but I need to win A and B. But opponent could put 11 in A, but they can't since total is 20. Wait, opponent's maximum in A is 20. So if I do 10,10,0, opponent could do 11,9,0. Then A:10<11, B:10>9, C:0=0. So I win B, lose A. Tie C. So only one win. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, 12,8,0. Opponent does 13,7,0: A lose, B win, C tie. Still one win.\n\nSo putting 0 is risky because opponent can take the other two.\n\nHmm. Maybe safest to have all three fields with at least some troops, but two higher. Like 7,7,6 is natural. To beat that, need two fields over 7. So 8,8,4.\n\nYes, 8+8+4=20. Let's confirm:\n\n- If opponent plays 7,7,6: I win A (8>7), win B (8>7), lose C (4<6). Two wins → I win round.\n\n- If opponent plays 8,7,5: I win A (8=8? Tie), win B (8>7), lose C (4<5). One win, one tie → only one win, so lose.\n\nWait, ties don't count as wins, so in that case, only B is a win. So if opponent plays 8,7,5, I get one win. Not enough.\n\nBut maybe opponent is less likely to play exactly 8,7,5. Maybe more likely to play balanced.\n\nAlternatively, 9,6,5. Sum 20. Against 7,7,6: A win (9>7), B lose (6<7), C lose (5<6). Only one win.\n\nBad.\n\nHmm. What about 7, 9, 4. Against 7,7,6: A tie, B win, C lose. One win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, maybe 10,5,5. Against 7,7,6: A win, B lose, C lose. One win.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the optimal is to have two fields at 7 and one at 6, but that's what opponent might do. So to beat that, have two at 8.\n\nAlternatively, think of all possible distributions where two fields are x and x, third is 20-2x. To win two, x needs to be higher than opponent's allocation on those two.\n\nAssuming opponent does similar, it's a game of what x they choose.\n\nIf I choose x=8 (8,8,4), then if opponent chooses x=7 (7,7,6), I win. If opponent chooses x=9 (9,9,2), I lose A and B.\n\nBut maybe x=8 is a middle ground.\n\nGiven that it's the first round, and no prior info, maybe 8,8,4 is a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, 7,7,6 is too balanced and might only tie often.\n\nWait, but if both play 7,7,6, then all fields tie, so no one wins any, but the goal is to win two. Wait, no—if all are ties, then neither wins any battlefield, so no one wins the round? But the problem says \"win two battlefields per round\" to win the round. So if all are ties, then no one has won two, so maybe it's a draw? But the problem states \"Win two battlefields per round\"—so perhaps a round can be a draw if no one wins two. But the scoring says \"Rounds Won - Commander Alpha: 0, Commander Beta: 0\", implying that draws are possible.\n\nBut our goal is to maximize the chance to win two.\n\nGiven all that, I think 8,8,4 is a good first move to target beating the balanced strategy.\n\nSo I'll go with [A8 B8 C4].\n",

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to allocate 20 troops across three battlefields: A, B, and C. The goal is to win two out of the three fields. Since both players choose simultaneously, I have to think about what the opponent might do.\n\nHmm, common strategies in Colonel Blotto often involve spreading troops unevenly to cover possible opponent moves. Maybe putting more on two fields and less on the third. But if I do something predictable like 8-8-4, the opponent might counter that.\n\nWait, maybe a balanced approach? Like 7-7-6. But that's still close to even. Alternatively, maybe go heavy on one field and split the rest. For example, 10 on A, 5 on B, 5 on C. But if the opponent puts more on A, I lose that, but maybe win B and C. But if they spread differently...\n\nAlternatively, maybe 9-9-2. That way, if they go for two fields with medium numbers, I might take two. But if they put 10 on two fields, I lose. Hmm.\n\nWait, another thought: since it's the first round, maybe the opponent is testing common strategies. Maybe they'll do something like 8-7-5. So if I do 7-8-5, I can beat them on B. But this is guessing.\n\nAlternatively, using a strategy that covers multiple possibilities. Maybe 6-7-7. That way, if they have a low number on one of B or C, I take it. But not sure.\n\nWait, maybe a classic approach is to use a distribution that can win two fields against common allocations. For example, if I put 8 on A, 8 on B, and 4 on C. Then, if the opponent does something like 7-7-6, I win A and B. But if they do 9-9-2, I lose A and B. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, going for 10-6-4. Then, if they have less than 10 on A, I take it, and maybe split B and C. But if they put 11 on A, I lose A, but maybe win B and C if they're lower.\n\nWait, but since both players have exactly 20, the maximum someone can put on a single field is 20, but that leaves 0 on others, so if I have even 1 on two fields, I can win those two. But opponent probably won't do 20-0-0.\n\nCommon allocations might be around 7-7-6 or 8-7-5. Maybe a safe bet is to do 8-7-5, but as Commander Beta, maybe vary it. Wait, but I need to pick one.\n\nAlternatively, think of possible Nash equilibria. But I don't remember the exact equilibrium for 3 fields and 20 troops. Maybe a mixed strategy, but since it's one round, I have to pick a single allocation.\n\nAnother angle: to win two fields, I need to have higher than opponent on two. So perhaps allocate such that two fields have higher numbers, assuming opponent might spread more evenly.\n\nSuppose opponent does 7-7-6. If I do 8-8-4, then I beat them on A and B (8>7 each), but lose C (4<6). So I win two. If opponent does 9-6-5, then 8-8-4 would lose A (8<9), win B (8>6), win C (4>5? No, 4<5). Wait, 4 vs 5, so lose C. Then only win B. Not good.\n\nHmm, maybe 9-6-5. If opponent does 8-7-5, I win A (9>8), lose B (6<7), tie C (5=5)? Wait, but in Blotto, usually ties go to neither, so you need strictly more. So if both have 5 on C, no one wins it, so you need to win two fields with strict majority.\n\nWait, the problem says \"win two battlefields per round\". So to win a battlefield, you need more troops than opponent on that field. If equal, neither wins it, so you need two fields where you have strictly more.\n\nSo in the case of tie on a field, it's not counted as a win for either. Therefore, the strategy should aim to have two fields with higher numbers than opponent.\n\nTherefore, maybe better to avoid ties. So for example, if opponent does 7-7-6, I want to have two fields above 7 and 7, but that's hard because 8+8=16, leaving 4. So 8-8-4 as before. If opponent has 7-7-6, then 8-8-4 beats them on A and B. If opponent does 9-7-4, then I lose A (8<9), win B (8>7), and C is 4 vs 4, tie. So only one win. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, 9-7-4. If opponent does 8-8-4, then I win A (9>8), lose B (7<8), C is 4=4. So only one win. Hmm.\n\nWhat if I do 10-6-4. Against 9-7-4: A 10>9, B 6<7, C 4=4. So one win. Not good.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to have two fields with 7 and one with 6 (7-7-6). If opponent has, say, 8-7-5: then I lose A (7<8), tie B (7=7), win C (6>5). So only one win. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, 8-7-5. Against opponent's 7-7-6: win A (8>7), tie B (7=7), lose C (5<6). Only one win.\n\nHmm, tricky. Maybe the key is to have two fields that are slightly higher than common allocations.\n\nAnother thought: people often put more on the first field. So maybe opponent will have higher on A. So I can put less on A and more on B and C. Like A:5, B:10, C:5. Then if opponent does 8-7-5, I lose A (5<8), win B (10>7), tie C (5=5). Only one win.\n\nWait, maybe A:6, B:9, C:5. Against 7-7-6: lose A (6<7), win B (9>7), lose C (5<6). Only one.\n\nAlternatively, A:9, B:8, C:3. Against 8-7-5: win A and B, lose C. Good. Against 9-6-5: tie A, win B, lose C. Only one. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the optimal is to use a distribution that can cover common splits. Let's think of possible opponent allocations:\n\n1. Even split: 7-7-6 (since 20 isn't divisible by 3)\n2. One heavy field: 10-5-5\n3. Two heavy fields: 9-9-2\n4. Something like 8-7-5\n\nIf I choose 8-7-5, then:\n\n- Against 7-7-6: win A (8>7), tie B (7=7), lose C (5<6) → 1 win\n- Against 10-5-5: lose A (8<10), win B and C (7>5, 5=5? Tie C) → 1 win\n- Against 9-9-2: lose A and B, win C (5>2) → 1 win\n- Against 8-7-5: all ties → 0 wins\n\nNot great.\n\nWhat if I do 9-6-5:\n\n- Against 7-7-6: win A (9>7), lose B (6<7), lose C (5<6) → 0\n- Against 10-5-5: lose A (9<10), win B and C (6>5, 5=5) → 1\n- Against 9-9-2: tie A, lose B (6<9), win C (5>2) → 1\n- Against 8-7-5: win A (9>8), lose B (6<7), tie C → 1\n\nStill not great.\n\nHow about 7-8-5:\n\n- Against 7-7-6: tie A, win B (8>7), lose C (5<6) → 1\n- Against 10-5-5: lose A, win B and C (8>5, 5=5) → 1\n- Against 9-9-2: lose A and B, win C → 1\n- Against 8-7-5: lose A (7<8), win B (8>7), tie C → 1\n\nHmm. Maybe need to go for two fields with 8 and one with 4. 8-8-4:\n\n- Against 7-7-6: win A and B, lose C → 2 wins (good)\n- Against 10-5-5: lose A (8<10), win B and C (8>5, 4<5? C is 4 vs 5 → lose) → only B → 1 win\n- Against 9-9-2: lose A and B (8<9), win C (4>2) → 1 win\n- Against 8-7-5: win A (8=8? Tie), win B (8>7), lose C (4<5) → 1 win (since A is tie)\n\nWait, in the first case against 7-7-6, 8-8-4 would win A and B (since 8>7 each), so two wins, which is good. But against 10-5-5, you lose A, win B (8>5), but C is 4 vs 5, so lose C. So only B, one win. Against 9-9-2, lose A and B, win C. One win.\n\nBut maybe 8-8-4 is a good bet if opponent is using a more even split. Since first round, maybe opponent is trying even split. Let's assume opponent might do 7-7-6. Then 8-8-4 would win two fields.\n\nAlternatively, opponent might think that and go for 9-9-2, trying to win two fields with high numbers. Then 8-8-4 would lose A and B, but win C. So only one win.\n\nHmm. Maybe a safer allocation is 7-7-6. Wait, but then if opponent does 8-8-4, I lose A and B, tie C (6 vs 4? No, opponent's C is 4, my C is 6, so I win C. Wait: opponent's allocation is 8-8-4. My allocation is 7-7-6. Then:\n\nA: 7 vs 8 → lose\n\nB: 7 vs 8 → lose\n\nC: 6 vs 4 → win\n\nSo only one win. Not good.\n\nWait, maybe 9-7-4:\n\nAgainst 8-8-4:\n\nA:9>8, B:7<8, C:4=4 → 1 win.\n\nAgainst 7-7-6:\n\nA:9>7, B:7=7, C:4<6 → 1 win.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: what if I do 10-7-3.\n\nAgainst 9-8-3: A 10>9, B 7<8, C 3=3 → 1 win.\n\nAgainst 8-7-5: A 10>8, B 7=7, C 3<5 → 1 win.\n\nAgainst 7-7-6: A 10>7, B 7=7, C 3<6 → 1 win.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, maybe 6-7-7.\n\nAgainst 8-7-5: A 6<8, B 7=7, C 7>5 → 1 win.\n\nAgainst 7-7-6: A 6<7, B 7=7, C 7>6 → 1 win.\n\nAgainst 9-9-2: A 6<9, B 7<9, C 7>2 → 1 win.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to have two fields that sum up to more than 20/2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept that to win two fields, you need to have more than half the opponent's allocation on two fields.\n\nWait, maybe looking for a strategy that can beat common strategies. Let's say most people might allocate around 7-7-6. So if I do 8-8-4, as before, beats that. If opponent does 9-6-5, then 8-8-4: A 8<9, B 8>6, C 4<5 → only B, one win. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, 9-5-6.\n\nAgainst 7-7-6: A 9>7, B 5<7, C 6=6 → 1 win.\n\nNot better.\n\nWait, maybe 8-6-6.\n\nAgainst 7-7-6: A 8>7, B 6<7, C 6=6 → 1 win.\n\nAgainst 9-5-6: A 8<9, B 6>5, C 6=6 → 1 win.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: since the total is 20, if I put 11 on one field, then the remaining 9 on the other two. But opponent could put 12 on that field, but they have to split 20. If I do 11-5-4.\n\nIf opponent does 10-5-5: A 11>10, B 5=5, C 4<5 → 1 win.\n\nIf opponent does 9-9-2: A 11>9, B 5<9, C 4>2 → 2 wins (A and C). Oh, that's good.\n\nWait, 11-5-4 against 9-9-2:\n\nA: 11>9 → win\n\nB: 5<9 → lose\n\nC:4>2 → win\n\nSo two wins. Good.\n\nAgainst 7-7-6:\n\nA:11>7, B:5<7, C:4<6 → only A → 1 win.\n\nAgainst 8-7-5:\n\nA:11>8, B:5<7, C:4<5 → 1 win.\n\nHmm, but if opponent does 12-4-4:\n\nA:11<12, B:5>4, C:4=4 → 1 win.\n\nNot great, but maybe this allocation can win against certain strategies.\n\nBut the problem is, what's the most likely opponent strategy?\n\nSince it's round 1, maybe opponent is using a balanced approach like 7-7-6.\n\nBut if I do 8-8-4, as before, beats 7-7-6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe opponent is thinking the same and will do 8-8-4, so I should do 9-9-2 to beat two fields? But 9-9-2 vs 8-8-4: A 9>8, B 9>8, C 2<4. So two wins. But if opponent does 10-7-3, then 9-9-2: lose A (9<10), win B (9>7), win C (2<3? No, 2<3 so lose C). So only B.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the safest bet for round 1 is to go with a common strategy that covers two fields with 8 each, as it can beat more even distributions.\n\nSo I'll go with 8-8-4.\n",

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. So, this is Colonel Blotto, right? I need to allocate 20 troops across three battlefields: A, B, and C. The goal is to win two out of the three to get the round. Last round, both Commander Alpha and Beta put 8, 8, 4, which resulted in a tie. So now it's Round 2.\n\nHmm, the problem is that if both players do the same thing, they tie. So maybe I need to adjust my strategy to counter what Beta might do. Last time, Beta matched Alpha's allocation exactly. Wait, but in Round 1, the user (Commander Alpha) chose [A8 B8 C4], and Beta also did the same. So maybe Beta is mirroring or using a similar strategy.\n\nBut in this case, since it's Round 2, I need to think about what Beta will do next. If Beta thinks that Alpha might repeat the same allocation, they might adjust. But since last time it was a tie, maybe Beta will shift some troops to one of the fields to try to win two.\n\nWait, but as Alpha, I need to anticipate Beta's move. Let's think about possible strategies. Common strategies in Blotto include spreading out, focusing on two fields, or trying to outguess the opponent.\n\nIn Round 1, both put 8,8,4. So fields A and B were tied, C was tied as well. All ties. So no one won any fields. Hence the overall tie.\n\nFor Round 2, perhaps Beta will try to win two fields by shifting troops. For example, if Beta thinks Alpha might do something similar, maybe Beta will put more into C and less into A or B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta will try a 9,9,2 or something like that. Wait, but the total has to be 20.\n\nWait, another thought: since the previous round was a tie with 8,8,4, maybe the opponent will try to take two fields by, say, increasing one field where they expect the opponent to have less.\n\nBut since both players are trying to outguess each other, maybe a good approach is to randomize or use a strategy that covers possible opponent moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go for a 7,7,6 allocation. Wait, but why?\n\nWait, if I put more into C, which had 4 before, maybe the opponent reduces there. Let's think.\n\nSuppose in Round 1, both did 8,8,4. So for Round 2, if Beta expects Alpha to do something similar, maybe Beta will do 9,9,2 to win A and B if Alpha does 8,8,4 again. But if Alpha changes, say, to 7,7,6, then against Beta's 9,9,2, Alpha would lose A and B but win C (6 vs 2), so still lose the round.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha does 10, 6, 4. Then against Beta's possible 9,9,2: A:10 vs9 (win), B:6 vs9 (lose), C:4 vs2 (win). So Alpha would win A and C, thus the round.\n\nBut this is speculative. Maybe Beta will anticipate that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a common strategy is to allocate in a way that covers the possibilities. Let's think about possible allocations that can win two fields against likely opponent moves.\n\nAnother angle: since the total is 20, splitting as 7,7,6 gives three fields where two are 7 and one is 6. If the opponent has, say, 8,8,4, then:\n\n- Against 7,7,6: A:7 vs8 (lose), B:7 vs8 (lose), C:6 vs4 (win). So only win C, lose the round.\n\nNot good. So maybe 9,9,2: against 8,8,4, A:9>8, B:9>8, C:2<4. So win A and B, win round.\n\nBut if opponent switches to 9,9,2, then if I do 10,10,0: but wait, 10+10+0=20. Then A:10>9, B:10>9, C:0<2. Win A and B. But opponent might not do 9,9,2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a better approach is to use an allocation that can beat common strategies. For example, 10, 6, 4.\n\nWait, let's think of possible opponent allocations. Suppose Beta might try to do 7,7,6. If I do 8,8,4 again, then:\n\nA:8 vs7 (win), B:8 vs7 (win), C:4 vs6 (lose). So I win two, win the round.\n\nBut if Beta anticipates that and does 9,9,2, then:\n\nA:8 vs9 (lose), B:8 vs9 (lose), C:4 vs2 (win). Only win C, lose round.\n\nHmm. So if I stick with 8,8,4, and Beta changes to 9,9,2, I lose.\n\nAlternatively, if I shift to 9,9,2 myself. Then if Beta does 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:9>8, C:2<4. Win two, win round.\n\nBut if Beta also shifts to 9,9,2, then tie again on all fields. Wait, 9,9,2 vs 9,9,2: all ties. So round tie.\n\nBut maybe Beta would shift to something else. Like 10, 8, 2. Wait, 10+8+2=20.\n\nIf I do 9,9,2 and Beta does 10,8,2:\n\nA:9 vs10 (lose), B:9 vs8 (win), C:2 vs2 (tie). So I win B, tie C. So only one win, need two. So lose the round.\n\nHmm. Not good.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe 7, 8, 5. Let's see.\n\nIf Beta did 9,9,2:\n\nA:7 vs9 (lose), B:8 vs9 (lose), C:5 vs2 (win). Only one win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if I do 10, 7, 3.\n\nAgainst Beta's possible 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9 (win), B:7<9 (lose), C:3>2 (win). So win A and C. Good.\n\nBut if Beta does 10,7,3 as well, then all ties.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does 8,8,4:\n\nA:10>8, B:7<8, C:3<4. Win only A. Lose round.\n\nHmm. So depends on what Beta does.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe a better approach is to look for a strategy that covers multiple possibilities.\n\nAnother common tactic is to have two fields with higher numbers and one low. For example, 9,9,2 as before.\n\nAlternatively, 10, 6, 4.\n\nLet me check against some possibilities.\n\nSuppose Beta uses 8,8,4 again:\n\nA:10>8 (win), B:6<8 (lose), C:4=4 (tie). So win A, tie C. So only one win. Not enough. Need two.\n\nAh, right. So 10,6,4 against 8,8,4 gives one win and a tie. Not sufficient.\n\nHmm. So maybe 9,7,4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:7<8, C:4=4. Again, one win and a tie.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, to win two fields against 8,8,4, need to have two fields higher than 8. But since 8+8+4=20, to have two fields above 8 would require at least 9 and 9, which sums to 18, leaving 2 for the third. So 9,9,2.\n\nSo if I do 9,9,2, against 8,8,4: win A and B.\n\nBut if Beta anticipates that and does 10,10,0, then:\n\nA:9<10, B:9<10, C:2>0. So only win C. Lose.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does 7,7,6:\n\nA:9>7, B:9>7, C:2<6. Win two, good.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut what if Beta switches to 10, 6, 4.\n\nThen 9,9,2 vs 10,6,4:\n\nA:9<10 (lose), B:9>6 (win), C:2<4 (lose). Only one win.\n\nBad.\n\nSo 9,9,2 is good against some allocations but bad against others.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe use an uneven distribution like 11, 5, 4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:11>8, B:5<8, C:4=4. One win, one tie. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I do 7, 9, 4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:7<8, B:9>8, C:4=4. One win, one tie.\n\nStill not two wins.\n\nWait, to get two wins against 8,8,4, need to have two fields >8. Which as before, requires at least 9 and 9.\n\nBut if I do 9,9,2, then if Beta does 10, 8, 2:\n\nA:9<10, B:9>8, C:2=2. One win, one tie. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta will shift troops from C to A and B. Like in Round 1, C had 4. If Beta thinks that Alpha might lower C, Beta might also lower C.\n\nAlternatively, another common strategy is to play 10, 9, 1.\n\nWait, but total must be 20.\n\nWait, maybe 10, 7, 3.\n\nLet's see.\n\nBut how to cover possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, think about what's the minimal number to win a field. If I put 0 in one field, opponent can take it with 1, but maybe that's okay if I win the other two.\n\nFor example, 10,10,0. But if opponent does 9,9,2, then:\n\nA:10>9, B:10>9, C:0<2. Win two, good.\n\nBut if opponent does 11,9,0:\n\nA:10<11, B:10>9, C:0=0. One win.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut opponent would have to put 0 in C as well.\n\nAlternatively, 11,9,0 totals 20.\n\nWait, 11+9+0=20.\n\nIf I do 10,10,0 and opponent does 11,9,0:\n\nA: lose, B: win, C: tie. Not enough.\n\nThis is complicated.\n\nMaybe another angle: since Round 1 was a tie with 8,8,4, perhaps Round 2 both players will try to adjust. If I assume Beta will increase A and B to 9 each, putting 2 in C (9,9,2), then I should maybe put 10 in A, 8 in B, and 2 in C. Wait, 10+8+2=20.\n\nAgainst Beta's 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9 (win), B:8<9 (lose), C:2=2 (tie). So one win, not enough.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, if I do 9,10,1:\n\nA:9 vs9 (tie), B:10>9 (win), C:1<2 (lose). Only one win.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, to beat 9,9,2, need two fields >9. So 10,10,0.\n\nWhich would win A and B.\n\nBut if Beta anticipates that and does 11, 9, 0:\n\nA:10<11, B:10>9, C:0=0. One win.\n\nSo risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a safer approach is to go for 7, 8, 5.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Since the opponent matched last time, maybe they will deviate now. If I assume that Beta will try to win two fields by putting more into two, but which ones?\n\nAlternatively, use a strategy that covers multiple possibilities. For example, 8,7,5.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nAlternatively, think of possible allocations that can win against both 8,8,4 and 9,9,2.\n\nFor example, 10, 7, 3.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:10>8, B:7<8, C:3<4. Only A win.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:10>9, B:7<9, C:3>2. So A and C wins. Good.\n\nBut against 8,8,4, only one win. So if Beta sticks with 8,8,4, this allocation loses.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, 9, 8, 3.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:8=8, C:3<4. One win, one tie.\n\nNot enough.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:9=9, B:8<9, C:3>2. One win.\n\nStill not two.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat about 10, 6, 4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A: win, B: lose, C: tie. One win.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:10>9, B:6<9, C:4>2. Two wins.\n\nSo if Beta switches to 9,9,2, this works. If Beta stays with 8,8,4, it doesn't.\n\nBut since Beta tied last round, they might change. So perhaps Beta will do 9,9,2.\n\nSo if I do 10,6,4, I can beat 9,9,2.\n\nBut what if Beta does something else, like 7,7,6?\n\n10,6,4 vs 7,7,6: A:10>7, B:6<7, C:4<6. Only A win.\n\nLose.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Do 7,9,4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:7<8, B:9>8, C:4=4. One win.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:7<9, B:9=9, C:4>2. One win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, maybe 11,5,4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A: win, B: lose, C: tie. One.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:11>9, B:5<9, C:4>2. Two wins.\n\nBut against 7,7,6: A: win, B: lose, C: lose. One.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to consider what's the most probable move from Beta.\n\nSince last round was a tie with 8,8,4, Beta might try to win two fields by increasing two fields by 1 each, so 9,9,2.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might shift troops from C to A and B, making it 9,9,2.\n\nIf I think Beta will do that, then I should aim to beat 9,9,2.\n\nTo beat 9,9,2, I need two fields higher than 9 and 9. So 10 and 10, but that leaves 0 for C. So 10,10,0.\n\nBut if Beta instead does 10,8,2, then:\n\nA:10 vs10 (tie), B:10>8 (win), C:0<2 (lose). One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, 11,9,0.\n\nBut if Beta does 9,9,2:\n\nA:11>9, B:9=9, C:0<2. One win and a tie.\n\nNot two wins.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, 10,9,1.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9, B:9=9, C:1<2. One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nWhat if I do 9,10,1.\n\nSame issue.\n\nAlternatively, 10,8,2.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9, B:8<9, C:2=2. One win.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, to get two wins against 9,9,2, need two fields >9. So minimum 10 and 10.\n\nSo 10,10,0.\n\nBut as above.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does 8,10,2.\n\nThen 10,10,0 vs 8,10,2:\n\nA: win, B: tie, C: lose. One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nThis is tough.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe instead of trying to counter a specific move, use a balanced allocation that has flexibility.\n\nLike 7, 7, 6.\n\nIf Beta did 8,8,4:\n\nA:7<8, B:7<8, C:6>4. Win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nNot good.\n\nHow about 9,7,4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:7<8, C:4=4. One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I do 8,9,3.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:8=8, B:9>8, C:3<4. One win.\n\nAgainst Beta's possible 9,9,2: A:8<9, B:9=9, C:3>2. One win.\n\nStill no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe go for 10,4,6.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:10>8, B:4<8, C:6>4. Win A and C. That's two. Good.\n\nAgainst Beta's 9,9,2: A:10>9, B:4<9, C:6>2. Win A and C. Also two.\n\nOh, this might be a good allocation.\n\nLet's check:\n\n10 + 4 + 6 = 20. Yes.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4:\n\nA:10 vs8 → win\n\nB:4 vs8 → lose\n\nC:6 vs4 → win\n\nSo win two fields. Good.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9, B:4<9, C:6>2. Win two.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6:\n\nA:10>7, B:4<7, C:6=6. One win and a tie. Wait, C is tie. So win A, tie C. Only one win. Not enough.\n\nHmm. If Beta does 7,7,6, this allocation only gets one win.\n\nBut maybe Beta is more likely to increase from the previous round rather than decrease.\n\nPrevious round both did 8,8,4. If Beta is trying to win, they might go to 9,9,2.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta thinks Alpha will do something else, but assuming Beta is logical, they might go for 9,9,2.\n\nAlso, against other allocations like 10,7,3:\n\n10,4,6 vs 10,7,3:\n\nA: tie, B:4<7, C:6>3. Win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut maybe 10,4,6 covers the most likely Beta moves.\n\nAlternatively, 11,5,4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: win A, lose B, tie C. One win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, back to 10,4,6. Seems decent against 8,8,4 and 9,9,2.\n\nAnother possible Beta allocation: 8,7,5.\n\n10,4,6 vs 8,7,5:\n\nA: win, B: lose (4<7), C: win (6>5). Two wins. Good.\n\nHmm, that works.\n\nWhat if Beta does 9,8,3.\n\n10,4,6 vs 9,8,3:\n\nA: win, B: lose, C: win. Two wins.\n\nYes.\n\nSo 10,4,6 seems to beat many common allocations.\n\nWait, let's check against 7,10,3.\n\nA:10>7, B:4<10, C:6>3. Win A and C. Good.\n\nAnother one: 6, 10,4.\n\nSame as above.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat about Beta doing 5,5,10.\n\n10,4,6 vs 5,5,10:\n\nA: win, B: win (4>5? No, 4<5), C:6<10. Wait:\n\nA:10>5 (win), B:4<5 (lose), C:6<10 (lose). Only A win. Lose round.\n\nAh, problem here. If Beta concentrates on C with 10, then this allocation loses.\n\nBut is that a likely move? Beta might not put 10 on C since in previous round C had 4. Maybe less likely.\n\nBut possible.\n\nHowever, considering that in Round 1, both had 4 on C, maybe Beta would think to lower C and reinforce others, rather than increase C.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is more likely to decrease C.\n\nSo 10,4,6 might be a solid choice.\n\nAlternatively, 11,3,6.\n\nBut similar issues.\n\nWait, another allocation: 9,5,6.\n\n9+5+6=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:5<8, C:6>4. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:9=9, B:5<9, C:6>2. One win.\n\nHmm, not as good.\n\nSo back to 10,4,6.\n\nAlternatively, 10,5,5.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A: win, B:5<8, C:5>4. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:10>9, B:5<9, C:5>2. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6: A: win, B: lose, C:5<6. One win.\n\nHmm, but 10,5,5.\n\nWait, 10+5+5=20.\n\nYes.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: win A and C.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: win A and C.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6: win A, lose B and C (5<7 and 5<6). Only A.\n\nBut maybe Beta is unlikely to go to 7,7,6.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do 10,10,0.\n\n10,5,5 vs 10,10,0:\n\nA: tie, B:5<10, C:5>0. Win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut how likely is Beta to do 10,10,0?\n\nNot sure.\n\nBut 10,5,5 seems better than 10,4,6 in some cases.\n\nWait, against 9,8,3:\n\n10,5,5 vs 9,8,3:\n\nA: win, B:5<8, C:5>3. Win A and C.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst 6,6,8:\n\nA:10>6, B:5<6, C:5<8. Win only A.\n\nLose.\n\nBut again, if Beta shifts to higher C.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the best bet is to go with 10,4,6 or 10,5,5.\n\nWait, another angle: the classic Blotto strategy often involves splitting into three unequal parts to cover different possibilities.\n\nWait, but given that the opponent mirrored last time, maybe they will shift. If I choose 10,4,6, it might catch them off guard.\n\nAlternatively, if I think Beta will do 9,9,2, then 10,6,4 would win A and C.\n\nWait, 10+6+4=20.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9, B:6<9, C:4>2. Win two.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4:\n\nA: win, B: lose, C: tie. One win.\n\nBut if Beta changed to 9,9,2, which is likely, then 10,6,4 works.\n\nBut if Beta stays at 8,8,4, then it doesn't.\n\nBut since Round 1 tied, Beta likely changes.\n\nSo 10,6,4 might be good.\n\nWait, but 10,6,4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother check: against 7,7,6.\n\nA:10>7, B:6<7, C:4<6. Only A. Lose.\n\nBut maybe Beta won't do that.\n\nAlternatively, 11,5,4.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:11>9, B:5<9, C:4>2. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A: win, B: lose, C: tie. One win.\n\nSame issue.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy here is to go for two fields just above the previous allocation's common numbers.\n\nSince both did 8 in A and B, putting 9 in A and B would require 9,9,2.\n\nBut if I go 10,9,1.\n\nWait, 10+9+1=20.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9, B:9=9, C:1<2. One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another idea: If I allocate 7, 10, 3.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:7<8, B:10>8, C:3<4. Win B only.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:7<9, B:10>9, C:3>2. Win B and C.\n\nSo if Beta does 9,9,2, this works.\n\nBut if Beta does 8,8,4, it doesn't.\n\nBut again, assuming Beta changes.\n\n7,10,3.\n\nBut why 7 and 3?\n\nAlternatively, 6,11,3.\n\nSame idea.\n\nBut perhaps 7,10,3 is reasonable.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nThis is really time-consuming. Maybe I should go with 10,6,4.\n\nOr 9,7,4.\n\nWait, 9+7+4=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:7<8, C:4=4. One win.\n\nNo good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, going back to the idea of 10,4,6. It beats the likely 9,9,2 and also 8,8,4 (wait, no: against 8,8,4, 10,4,6 gives two wins: A and C).\n\nWait, 10 in A beats 8, 4 in B loses to 8, 6 in C beats 4. So two wins. Yes!\n\nOh! I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nIf I do 10,4,6 against 8,8,4:\n\nA:10 vs8 → Win\n\nB:4 vs8 → Lose\n\nC:6 vs4 → Win\n\nSo two wins, which means I win the round.\n\nOh! That's good. So this allocation actually beats the previous allocation.\n\nAnd against 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9, B:4<9, C:6>2 → Two wins.\n\nAlso good.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6:\n\nA:10>7, B:4<7, C:6=6 → Win A, Tie C. Only one win. Not enough.\n\nBut if Beta shifts from 8,8,4 to 7,7,6, which is a decrease in A and B by 1 each and increase in C by 2, is that likely?\n\nPossibly, but maybe less likely than increasing A and B.\n\nBut in any case, 10,4,6 beats both 8,8,4 and 9,9,2.\n\nWhat about against 10,7,3:\n\nA:10=10, B:4<7, C:6>3. Win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nBut if Beta does 10,7,3, which is possible.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut given that in Round 1 it was 8,8,4, moving to 10,7,3 is a possibility.\n\nBut how to cover all bases.\n\nAlternatively, 11,5,4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A: win, B: lose, C: tie. One win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, back to 10,4,6.\n\nIt's looking pretty good against the most probable Beta moves.\n\nAnother check: against 9,8,3.\n\nA:10>9, B:4<8, C:6>3. Two wins.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst 8,9,3.\n\nSame as above.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst 7,10,3.\n\nA:10>7, B:4<10, C:6>3. Two wins.\n\nYes.\n\nThe main weakness is if Beta allocates more to C, like 5,5,10.\n\nBut as mentioned earlier, that might be less likely since both players had 4 in C previously.\n\nSo perhaps 10,4,6 is a solid choice.\n\nAnother allocation to consider: 9, 5, 6.\n\n9+5+6=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:5<8, C:6>4. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:9=9, B:5<9, C:6>2. One win.\n\nHmm, so loses to 9,9,2.\n\nWhereas 10,4,6 beats 9,9,2.\n\nSo 10,4,6 better.\n\nHow about 10,3,7.\n\n10+3+7=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A: win, B: lose, C:7>4. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A: win, B: lose, C:7>2. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6: A: win, B: lose, C:7>6. Two wins.\n\nOh! This seems better.\n\nWait:\n\n10,3,7.\n\nCheck against various Beta allocations.\n\nBeta's possible moves:\n\n1. 8,8,4:\n\nA:10>8, B:3<8, C:7>4 → Win A and C. Good.\n\n2. 9,9,2:\n\nA:10>9, B:3<9, C:7>2 → Win A and C.\n\n3. 7,7,6:\n\nA:10>7, B:3<7, C:7>6 → Win A and C.\n\n4. 10,7,3:\n\nA:10=10, B:3<7, C:7>3 → Win C only. Lose.\n\nAh, here's a problem. If Beta does 10,7,3.\n\nBut is 10,7,3 a likely allocation?\n\nIf Beta is coming from 8,8,4, they might increase A to 10, decrease B to 7, and put 3 in C.\n\nPossibly.\n\nBut against that, 10,3,7 only wins C.\n\nLose the round.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother potential issue.\n\nBut how likely is Beta to do that?\n\nAlternatively, if I do 11,2,7.\n\nBut similar issues.\n\nWait, 10,3,7 seems good against many but vulnerable to allocations where B is low and C is medium.\n\nAnother check: Beta does 9,10,1.\n\nA:10>9, B:3<10, C:7>1. Win A and C.\n\nGood.\n\nBeta does 5,10,5.\n\nA: win, B: lose, C:7>5. Win A and C.\n\nGood.\n\nBeta does 4,4,12.\n\nA: win, B: win (3>4? No, 3<4), C: lose. Wait:\n\nA:10>4, B:3<4, C:7<12. Only A win. Lose.\n\nBut 12 in C is a big shift. Unlikely if previous was 4.\n\nSo maybe 10,3,7 is pretty solid.\n\nWait, another allocation: 11,3,6.\n\n11+3+6=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: Win A and C.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: Win A and C.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6: Win A and C (6 vs6 tie? No, 6=6).\n\nWait:\n\n11,3,6 vs 7,7,6:\n\nA:11>7, B:3<7, C:6=6. One win and a tie.\n\nOnly one win. Not enough.\n\nWhereas 10,3,7 vs 7,7,6:\n\nC:7>6, so two wins.\n\nAh, so 10,3,7 is better against 7,7,6.\n\nSo 10,3,7 covers that.\n\nWait, let's recheck:\n\n10,3,7 vs 7,7,6.\n\nA:10-7= win\n\nB:3-7= lose\n\nC:7-6= win\n\nYes, two wins.\n\nGood.\n\nNow, against Beta's allocation of 10,7,3:\n\nA:10 vs10 = tie\n\nB:3 vs7 = lose\n\nC:7 vs3 = win\n\nSo only one win (C), so lose the round.\n\nBut how likely is Beta to do 10,7,3?\n\nIf Beta anticipates that Alpha will up A to 9 or 10, they might match A and strengthen elsewhere.\n\nBut it's a possible move.\n\nHowever, considering common strategies, perhaps 10,3,7 is a good balance.\n\nAnother check: Beta does 9,8,3.\n\n10,3,7 vs9,8,3:\n\nA: win, B: lose, C: win. Two wins.\n\nGood.\n\nBeta does 8,9,3:\n\nSame.\n\nGood.\n\nBeta does 7,8,5:\n\nA: win, B: lose, C:7>5. Two wins.\n\nYes.\n\nThe main weakness is when Beta allocates 10 or more in A and a moderate amount in B and low in C.\n\nBut given the previous round's allocation, maybe Beta is more likely to adjust within similar ranges.\n\nGiven all this, I think 10,3,7 is a strong candidate.\n\nWait, but 3 in B seems very low. Could Beta exploit that by putting just 4 in B?\n\nIf Beta does 8,4,8.\n\nWait, 8+4+8=20.\n\n10,3,7 vs8,4,8:\n\nA: win, B:3<4, C:7<8. Only A win. Lose.\n\nBut would Beta do 8,4,8?\n\nThat's spreading more to C.\n\nPossible, but again, shifting from 4 to 8 in C is a big jump.\n\nBut if they think Alpha will lower C...\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is really hard to predict.\n\nAlternative idea: Use 9, 10, 1.\n\nBut 9+10+1=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:10>8, C:1<4. Win A and B. Good.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:9=9, B:10>9, C:1<2. Win B only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nSo if Beta does 9,9,2, this loses.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut against 8,8,4 it's great.\n\nBut Beta likely changes.\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nWait, going back. The best allocation seems to be one that beats both 8,8,4 and likely adjustments like 9,9,2.\n\nWe saw that 10,4,6 and 10,3,7 both do that.\n\nBetween them, 10,3,7 also beats 7,7,6.\n\nBut 10,4,6 against 7,7,6:\n\nA:10>7, B:4<7, C:6=6. One win.\n\nWhereas 10,3,7 gets two.\n\nSo 10,3,7 is better there.\n\nBut 10,4,6 against 5,5,10:\n\nA: win, B: lose, C: lose.\n\nSame as 10,3,7: A: win, B: lose, C: lose.\n\nBoth lose.\n\nSo similar there.\n\nAnother factor: minimizing the risk if Beta does something unexpected.\n\nBut hard to say.\n\nWait, what about 11, 2, 7.\n\nSame as 10,3,7 but shifted.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: same result.\n\nBut 11 might be overkill on A.\n\nAlternatively, 9, 3, 8.\n\n9+3+8=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:3<8, C:8>4. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:9=9, B:3<9, C:8>2. One win.\n\nNot as good as 10,3,7.\n\nHmm.\n\nAfter considering various options, I think 10,3,7 or 10,4,6 are the top candidates.\n\nWait, another check: 10,3,7.\n\nIf Beta does 10,3,7 as well:\n\nAll fields tie. Round tie.\n\nBut if Beta copies, then tie. Not ideal, but possible.\n\nWhereas if I do something unique.\n\nAlternatively, 10,2,8.\n\nBut 8 in C might be too much.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: Win A and C.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: Win A and C.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6: Win A and C.\n\nBut vulnerable to high C.\n\nBut again.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll go with 10,3,7.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the sum: 10+3+7=20. Yes.\n\nAlternatively, 10,4,6 sums to 20.\n\nBoth are valid.\n\nWhich one is better?\n\n10,4,6 against 10,7,3:\n\nA: tie, B:4<7, C:6>3. Win C.\n\nOne win.\n\nSame as 10,3,7 against 10,7,3.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait 10,3,7 vs 10,7,3:\n\nA: tie, B:3<7, C:7>3. Win C only.\n\nSame as 10,4,6 vs 10,7,3: Win C.\n\nSo same result.\n\nAnother point: 10,3,7 has C=7 which might be better against medium-high C allocations.\n\nBut I think both are similar.\n\nWait, what if I do 9, 2, 9.\n\n9+2+9=20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:2<8, C:9>4. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: A:9=9, B:2<9, C:9>2. One win.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nBack to square one.\n\nGiven that 10,4,6 beats both previous allocation and 9,9,2, and covers several other scenarios, I think that's a safe bet.\n\nSo final decision: A10 B4 C6.\n\nWhich is [A10 B4 C6].\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, we're playing Colonel Blotto, and I'm Commander Beta. The goal is to allocate 20 troops across three battlefields (A, B, C) each round, trying to win two out of the three to get a round win.\n\nIn Round 1, both sides played A:8, B:8, C:4, resulting in a tie. So now it's Round 2. I need to adjust my strategy based on what Alpha did last time. Since they mirrored my allocation, maybe they're trying to copy my moves. But since it's a simultaneous game, they probably don't know my move in advance. Wait, but in Round 1, I was Beta and played that allocation, and Alpha also played the same. Maybe Alpha is using a strategy of copying previous moves or some symmetric approach.\n\nHmm, if Alpha is likely to repeat the same allocation, then I need to shift my troops to win two fields. But since they might anticipate that, I need to be tricky. Let me think. If Alpha plays A:8, B:8, C:4 again, how can I beat that?\n\nTo win a battlefield, I need to have more troops than Alpha on that field. So, for example, if I put 9 on A, 9 on B, and 2 on C, but wait, 9+9+2=20. But then against Alpha's 8,8,4: A:9>8 (win), B:9>8 (win), C:2<4 (lose). So I win two fields. But wait, would Alpha play the same again? Maybe not. They might adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will shift their troops in response. Since Round 1 was a tie, perhaps they'll try to redistribute. But without knowing their next move, I have to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach: in Blotto games, common strategies involve focusing on two fields and sacrificing one. So, for example, putting more on two fields and minimal on the third. But since the opponent might do the same, it's about predicting which fields they'll sacrifice.\n\nIn Round 1, both put 8,8,4. So C was the lower one. Maybe Alpha will again put less on C, so I could put more on C to win it, while adjusting A and B.\n\nWait, if Alpha repeats 8,8,4, then to beat them, I need to have more than 8 on two fields. But since total is 20, if I put 9 on A and 9 on B, that's 18, leaving 2 for C. Then A and B are wins, C is a loss. That works. But if Alpha changes, say, puts 7 on A, 7 on B, 6 on C, then my 9,9,2 would win A and B still. But maybe Alpha will shift more to C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will anticipate that I'll go for A and B again and shift their troops. Suppose Alpha moves to 7,7,6. Then if I do 9,9,2, I still win A and B. But if Alpha does something like 10,5,5, then my 9,9,2 would lose A (9<10), win B (9>5), win C (2<5? No, 2<5 so lose C. Wait, 10,5,5: if I have 9,9,2: A:9<10 (lose), B:9>5 (win), C:2<5 (lose). So I lose both A and C, only win B. That's bad.\n\nHmm, so maybe a better approach is to vary the allocation. Maybe put more on C this time. For example, if I do A:7, B:7, C:6. Then against Alpha's previous 8,8,4: A:7<8 (lose), B:7<8 (lose), C:6>4 (win). That's only one win, which isn't enough. Not good.\n\nWait, maybe I need to target two fields where Alpha might have less. If Alpha is likely to keep C low again, like 4, then putting 5 on C would win it. Then I need to win one more. Suppose I do A:10, B:5, C:5. Against 8,8,4: A:10>8 (win), B:5<8 (lose), C:5>4 (win). So two wins. But if Alpha changes to, say, 7,7,6, then A:10>7 (win), B:5<7 (lose), C:5<6 (lose). Only one win. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, A:9, B:7, C:4. Total 20. Against 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:7<8, C:4=4 (tie). So only one win. Not enough.\n\nWhat if I do A:8, B:9, C:3. Then against 8,8,4: A:8=8 (tie), B:9>8 (win), C:3<4 (lose). Only one win.\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is to have two fields where I have more than Alpha. Since Alpha did 8,8,4 last time, if they do the same again, then 9,9,2 works. But if they adjust, maybe moving 1 from C to A or B. Like 9,8,3. Then my 9,9,2 would be A:9=9 (tie), B:9>8 (win), C:2<3 (lose). Only one win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will shift to a different distribution. Maybe they'll go for 7,9,4. Then if I do 9,9,2: A:9>7 (win), B:9=9 (tie), C:2<4 (lose). Only one win.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe a better strategy is to randomize or choose a less predictable allocation. For example, 10, 6, 4. Against 8,8,4: A:10>8 (win), B:6<8 (lose), C:4=4 (tie). Only one win. Not good.\n\nWait, 10,7,3: A:10>8, B:7<8, C:3<4. Only A win.\n\nHow about 7, 10, 3: Same issue.\n\nAlternatively, 9, 8, 3: A:9>8, B:8=8, C:3<4. One win.\n\nWait, maybe 9, 10, 1. But that's 20. Against 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:10>8, C:1<4. Two wins. That works. But if Alpha changes to, say, 9,7,4, then A:9=9, B:10>7, C:1<4. Still two wins (B and maybe A is tie, but need two wins. Wait, ties don't count as wins. So if A is tie, B is win, C is loss: only one win. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Maybe the safest bet is to go 9,9,2. Because if Alpha repeats 8,8,4, then I win A and B. If Alpha changes slightly, like moving 1 from A to C (7,8,5), then my 9,9,2 would be A:9>7, B:9>8, C:2<5. Still two wins. If Alpha moves more, like 6,8,6, then A:9>6, B:9>8, C:2<6. Still two wins. If Alpha shifts to 10,5,5, then A:9<10, B:9>5, C:2<5. Only one win. But how likely is Alpha to go to 10,5,5? Maybe not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will try to win two fields by putting more on two. Like 9,9,2 themselves. Then if I do 9,9,2, it's a tie again.\n\nWait, perhaps varying which field I sacrifice. In Round 1, both sacrificed C (4). So maybe this round, I should sacrifice a different field. Like put less on B instead. For example, A:9, B:2, C:9. Total 20. Against Alpha's 8,8,4: A:9>8 (win), B:2<8 (lose), C:9>4 (win). So two wins. That works. But if Alpha changes to, say, 4,8,8, then my A:9>4, B:2<8, C:9>8. Still two wins. Wait, but would Alpha rearrange the numbers across fields? Like maybe they put higher on C this time.\n\nWait, the fields are labeled A, B, C, so the opponent's allocation is specific to each field. So if Alpha in Round 1 did A:8, B:8, C:4, they might in Round 2 change to A:4, B:8, C:8, but that's a different strategy. But as Commander Beta, I don't know. But perhaps assuming they keep the same pattern (two high, one low), but maybe shift which one is low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll keep C as the low one again. So if I put high on A and C, sacrificing B. Like A:9, B:2, C:9. Then against 8,8,4: win A and C.\n\nBut if Alpha switches to making B the low one, say A:8, B:4, C:8, then my A:9>8, B:2<4 (wait, 2<4, so lose B), C:9>8. So win A and C, which is two. Still good.\n\nWait, but if Alpha does A:7, B:7, C:6, then my 9,2,9 would be A:9>7, B:2<7, C:9>6. Two wins.\n\nHmm, this seems more robust. By sacrificing B and putting 9 on A and C, I can win those two unless Alpha puts 10 or more on either. But since total is 20, if Alpha puts 10 on A, then they have 10 left for B and C. If they do 10,5,5, then my 9,2,9: A:9<10, B:2<5, C:9>5. Only C win. Not good.\n\nBut how likely is Alpha to put 10 on a single field? Maybe possible, but perhaps less likely. Alternatively, maybe a more balanced approach.\n\nAnother idea: use 7, 7, 6. Wait, against 8,8,4: A:7<8, B:7<8, C:6>4. Only one win. Not enough.\n\nWait, perhaps 10, 6, 4. As before, only A win.\n\nAlternatively, 8, 7, 5. Against 8,8,4: A:8=8, B:7<8, C:5>4. One win.\n\nNot good. How about 9, 7, 4. A:9>8, B:7<8, C:4=4. One win.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 9,9,2 is better. Let's check against possible Alpha moves.\n\nIf Alpha repeats 8,8,4: Beta wins A and B.\n\nIf Alpha does 9,8,3: Beta's 9,9,2 → A tie, B win, C lose. Only one win.\n\nIf Alpha does 7,9,4: A win (9>7), B tie (9=9), C lose. One win.\n\nIf Alpha does 10,5,5: A lose (9<10), B win (9>5), C lose (2<5). One win.\n\nSo in some cases, it only gives one win. But maybe the probability that Alpha repeats exactly 8,8,4 is high enough to justify it.\n\nAlternatively, if I shift to 10,8,2. Wait, 10+8+2=20. Against 8,8,4: A:10>8, B:8=8, C:2<4. One win.\n\nNot better.\n\nWait, what if I do 9, 10, 1. As before. Against 8,8,4: A and B wins.\n\nBut if Alpha changes to 8,7,5: A:9>8, B:10>7, C:1<5. Two wins.\n\nIf Alpha does 7,7,6: A:9>7, B:10>7, C:1<6. Two wins.\n\nIf Alpha goes 10,5,5: A:9<10, B:10>5, C:1<5. Only B win.\n\nSo still vulnerable if Alpha stacks one field.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more balanced 7, 8, 5. Wait, 7+8+5=20. Against 8,8,4: A:7<8, B:8=8, C:5>4. One win.\n\nNo good.\n\nWait, another approach: since the first round was a tie with 8,8,4, maybe the Nash equilibrium here involves mixing strategies, but since I have to pick one, perhaps the best is to randomize which field to under-allocate.\n\nBut as Beta, I need to pick a specific allocation. Given that, perhaps choosing to allocate 9,9,2 is a solid choice if I think Alpha might repeat. Alternatively, 10,7,3.\n\nWait, 10,7,3: A:10>8, B:7<8, C:3<4. Only A win. Not good.\n\nHmm. Maybe 9,8,3. A:9>8, B:8=8, C:3<4. One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nWait, what about 7, 9, 4. A:7<8, B:9>8, C:4=4. One win.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWait, maybe 8, 9, 3. A:8=8, B:9>8, C:3<4. One win.\n\nStill one.\n\nI'm struggling to find an allocation that guarantees two wins against possible Alpha moves. Maybe the key is to assume Alpha will change slightly, so I should shift my allocation to target where they might be weak.\n\nIn Round 1, both had C as the weakest (4). Maybe Alpha will increase C this round. Suppose they do 7,7,6. Then if I do 8,8,4 again, I lose A and B (7<8? Wait, no: if Alpha has 7,7,6 and I have 8,8,4: A:8>7, B:8>7, C:4<6. So two wins. Wait, but in Round 1, it was 8,8,4 vs same. If Alpha changes to 7,7,6, then my same allocation would win A and B.\n\nWait, but I am Commander Beta, so in Round 2, I can choose a new allocation. If I stick with 8,8,4 again, and Alpha changes to 7,7,6, then I win A and B. But if Alpha stays at 8,8,4, it's a tie again.\n\nBut since in Round 1 it was a tie, I don't want another tie. So I need to change.\n\nSo if I predict Alpha might lower A and B to boost C, then keeping A and B at 8 might work. But to ensure a win, maybe go to 9,9,2.\n\nAlternatively, another strategy: since 20 divided by 3 is roughly 6-7, but to win two you need to have higher on two. So maybe 7,7,6 is a common allocation. But if both do that, tie again.\n\nWait, perhaps looking for an asymmetric allocation. Like 5, 10, 5. Against 8,8,4: A:5<8, B:10>8, C:5>4. Two wins. Oh, this works. Let's check:\n\nIf Alpha has 8,8,4 and I do 5,10,5:\n\nA:5 vs 8 → lose\n\nB:10 vs 8 → win\n\nC:5 vs 4 → win\n\nSo two wins. Great.\n\nNow, what if Alpha changes their allocation? Suppose they go to 7,7,6.\n\nMy 5,10,5 vs 7,7,6:\n\nA:5<7, B:10>7, C:5<6. Only B win. Not good.\n\nBut if Alpha increases C, this might fail. However, if Alpha kept C at 4 or slightly higher, it works.\n\nAnother possibility: Alpha might think I'll target C and boost it. So if they go 8,7,5.\n\nMy 5,10,5: A:5<8, B:10>7, C:5=5. Tie on C. So only B win. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Maybe 6,10,4.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:6<8, B:10>8, C:4=4. One win.\n\nNot better.\n\nWait, 4, 10, 6.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:4<8, B:10>8, C:6>4. Two wins.\n\nSame as the 5,10,5 idea.\n\nIf Alpha changes to 7,7,6: A:4<7, B:10>7, C:6=6. One win.\n\nStill risky.\n\nAlternatively, 3, 11, 6.\n\nSame logic. Against 8,8,4: A lose, B win, C win.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6: A lose, B win, C tie. One win.\n\nNot better.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best bet is to go with 9,9,2 assuming Alpha repeats 8,8,4. Even though it's vulnerable to some changes, it's a solid play if they don't adjust much.\n\nAlternatively, another allocation: 10, 6, 4. Wait, as before, only A win against 8,8,4.\n\nNo. How about 7, 10, 3.\n\nA:7<8, B:10>8, C:3<4. One win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, 9, 7, 4. A:9>8, B:7<8, C:4=4. One win.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I do 10, 9, 1. Total 20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:10>8, B:9>8, C:1<4. Two wins.\n\nIf Alpha changes to 9,8,3: A:10>9, B:9>8, C:1<3. Two wins.\n\nIf Alpha does 7,7,6: A:10>7, B:9>7, C:1<6. Two wins.\n\nIf Alpha goes 10,5,5: A:10=10, B:9>5, C:1<5. One win (B).\n\nBut this allocation (10,9,1) seems robust against many distributions except when Alpha concentrates on A.\n\nBut how likely is Alpha to put 10 or more on A? If they do 11, but they can't since total is 20. Wait, maximum on one field is 20, but usually spread out.\n\nAnother test: if Alpha does 9,9,2 (mirroring my potential move), then my 10,9,1 vs 9,9,2: A:10>9, B:9=9, C:1<2. Only A win. Not good.\n\nAh, so if Alpha anticipates I'm going to shift to 10,9,1, they might do 9,9,2. Then I only win A.\n\nSo this is the cat-and-mouse game.\n\nGiven that Round 1 was a tie with symmetric 8,8,4, perhaps both players are likely to shift in different ways. Maybe a good strategy is to shift one field up by 1 and another down.\n\nFor example, from 8,8,4 to 9,8,3. But as we saw earlier, against 8,8,4 that gives only one win.\n\nAlternatively, 8,9,3: same issue.\n\nWait, another idea: in Blotto, a common tactic is to “sacrifice” one battlefield completely. So put 0 on one field and distribute 20 across the other two. But 0 might be too risky, but let's see.\n\nFor example, A:0, B:10, C:10.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:0<8, B:10>8, C:10>4. Two wins. Great.\n\nBut if Alpha anticipates this and puts, say, 0 on A as well, but boosts B and C. Wait, but Alpha doesn't know my move.\n\nIf I do 0,10,10, and Alpha repeats 8,8,4, I win B and C.\n\nIf Alpha changes to 7,7,6: same result, win B and C.\n\nIf Alpha does 5,5,10: A:0<5, B:10>5, C:10=10. Tie on C. So only B win. Not enough.\n\nBut if Alpha puts 10 on C, then C is tie. So risky.\n\nAlternatively, 0,11,9. Against 8,8,4: B and C wins.\n\nIf Alpha does 4,8,8: A:0<4, B:11>8, C:9<8? No, 9>8. So B and C wins.\n\nWait, C:9 vs 8: win. So still two wins.\n\nIf Alpha does 3,3,14: A:0<3, B:11>3, C:9<14. Only B win.\n\nBut is Alpha likely to put 14 on one field? Maybe not common.\n\nThe downside of sacrificing a field is if the opponent also sacrifices the same field, but since you win the other two. But if they don't, and put something there, you lose that field but hopefully win the others.\n\nIn this case, allocating 0 to A might be good if Alpha still puts significant on A. Since in Round 1 they had 8 on A, it's likely they'll have something there.\n\nSo 0,10,10 seems promising. Let's verify:\n\nTotal is 20. A:0, B:10, C:10.\n\nAgainst Alpha's 8,8,4: B:10>8, C:10>4. Win two.\n\nIf Alpha shifts to 7,7,6: same result.\n\nIf Alpha does 9,9,2: B:10>9, C:10>2. Win two.\n\nIf Alpha does 10,5,5: B:10=10, C:10>5. Win C, tie B. So only one win (C). Wait, tie on B means no win, so only C win. Not enough.\n\nAh, here's the problem. If Alpha puts 10 on B, then B is tie, and if they have 5 on C, I win C. But only one win.\n\nBut how likely is Alpha to put exactly 10 on B? Maybe not too likely, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, do 0,11,9. Then against 10,5,5: B:11>10, C:9>5. Two wins.\n\nWait, if Alpha does 10 on B, then 11 beats it. So 0,11,9 is better.\n\nLet's check 0,11,9:\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: B:11>8, C:9>4. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 9,9,2: B:11>9, C:9>2. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 10,5,5: B:11>10, C:9>5. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6: same, two wins.\n\nAgainst 5,10,5: A:0<5, B:11>10, C:9>5. Two wins.\n\nAgainst 4,8,8: B:11>8, C:9<8? No, 9>8. Two wins.\n\nWait, C:9 vs 8 is a win.\n\nOnly if Alpha puts 10 or more on both B and C could this fail. But with total 20, if they put 10 on B and 10 on C, that's 20, so A:0. Then my 0,11,9 vs their 0,10,10: B:11>10, C:9<10. So win B, lose C. One win.\n\nBut if Alpha does 0,10,10, then it's a tie on A (0=0), B:11>10, C:9<10. So I win B only.\n\nHowever, how likely is Alpha to sacrifice A as well? If both sacrifice A, then it comes down to B and C.\n\nBut in Round 1, both had 8 on A, so maybe less likely to go to 0 immediately.\n\nGiven that, 0,11,9 seems like a strong play. It beats most allocations where Alpha has moderate numbers on B and C.\n\nAlternatively, 1,10,9. Similar idea, but using 1 on A to maybe steal it if Alpha lowers A.\n\nBut if I put 1 on A, against Alpha's 8, it's still a loss. So not helpful.\n\nSo 0,11,9 might be good. Or 0,10,10.\n\nWait, 0,10,10 totals 20. Let's check against more scenarios.\n\nIf Alpha does 6,7,7: B:10>7, C:10>7. Two wins.\n\nIf Alpha does 5,5,10: B:10>5, C:10=10. One win.\n\nAh, problem here. So if Alpha puts 10 on C, tie there.\n\nBut if I do 0,11,9 instead:\n\nAgainst Alpha's 5,5,10: B:11>5, C:9<10. Only B win.\n\nStill one win.\n\nHmm. So sacrificing A is risky if Alpha loads up one of the other fields.\n\nAlternative idea: instead of sacrificing A, sacrifice C again but with different numbers.\n\nWait, in Round 1, C was 4 for both. If I put 5 on C, and more on A and B.\n\nLike A:9, B:6, C:5. Total 20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:9>8, B:6<8, C:5>4. Two wins (A and C).\n\nIf Alpha changes to 7,7,6: A:9>7, B:6<7, C:5<6. Only A win.\n\nNot good.\n\nBut if Alpha keeps C low, it works.\n\nAlternatively, A:7, B:8, C:5. Total 20.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4: A:7<8, B:8=8, C:5>4. One win.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, going back to the 9,9,2 idea. It's simple and if Alpha repeats Round 1's move, it wins two fields. Given that human players often repeat or make small adjustments, this might be a solid choice.\n\nAnother angle: since we tied in Round 1 with symmetric allocation, maybe Alpha will try to beat me by adding 1 to two fields. Like 9,9,2. If I anticipate that, I could do 10,10,0. But let's see.\n\nIf Alpha does 9,9,2 and I do 10,10,0: A:10>9, B:10>9, C:0<2. Two wins.\n\nBut if Alpha stays at 8,8,4, then 10,10,0 beats them too.\n\nWait, this might be a better plan. 10,10,0.\n\nCheck against various Alpha allocations:\n\n- vs 8,8,4: win A and B.\n\n- vs 9,9,2: win A and B.\n\n- vs 7,7,6: win A and B.\n\n- vs 10,5,5: A tie, B:10>5, C:0<5. Only B win.\n\nAh, problem. If Alpha puts 10 on A, it's a tie there.\n\nBut if Alpha does 11, but they can't since total is 20. Wait, 10,5,5 sums to 20.\n\nSo against 10,5,5: A tie, B win, C lose. One win.\n\nStill risky.\n\nBut how often would Alpha choose 10 on one field?\n\nAlternatively, 10,9,1.\n\nAs before.\n\nHmm.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, maybe the best practical choice is to go with 9,9,2. It's straightforward, beats the previous allocation, and is a common adjustment (adding 1 to two fields).\n\nSo my allocation would be A:9, B:9, C:2.\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out the best move for Colonel Blotto Round 3. So far, the game has had two rounds. \n\nIn Round 1, both players did [A8 B8 C4], which tied. Then in Round 2, I (Commander Alpha) played [A10 B4 C6], and Beta played [A9 B9 C2], so I won because I had more on A and C, while Beta won B. Since I won two fields (A and C), I took the round.\n\nNow, it's Round 3. I need to allocate 20 troops across A, B, C again. The goal is to win two out of three fields.\n\nFirst, I should think about what Beta might do. In Round 1, Beta mirrored my strategy. In Round 2, Beta used a more balanced approach on A and B with 9 each, and only 2 on C. But since I put 6 on C, I won that field. So Beta might adjust based on that.\n\nMaybe Beta will try to counter my previous moves. In Round 2, I put a lot on A (10), so maybe Beta will put more on A next time to counter. Or maybe Beta will spread out differently.\n\nAnother angle: since the game is about winning two fields, it's common in Blotto games to focus on two fields and sacrifice one. But the key is to anticipate the opponent's allocation.\n\nLooking at past rounds:\n\nRound 1: Both did 8,8,4. Tie.\n\nRound 2: I did 10,4,6; Beta did 9,9,2. I won A (10>9) and C (6>2), Beta won B (9>4). So I won two fields.\n\nSo Beta might realize that putting low on C (2) was bad because I had 6 there. So maybe Beta will increase C in Round 3.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might think I'll continue with high on A and C, so Beta might put more on B and C, or adjust.\n\nWait, in Round 2, Beta's allocation was 9,9,2. So they spread evenly on A and B, minimal on C. But I had more on A and C, so I won those two.\n\nFor Round 3, Beta might try to cover C better. Maybe Beta will put more on C, say 5 or 6. Then, if I do something similar to Round 2, like 10,4,6 again, Beta might have more on C this time, so I might lose C but need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta will switch to another strategy. Since the game is only 9 rounds, but each round is independent (I think), each round's allocation is fresh. Wait, in Colonel Blotto, each round is a separate game; the allocations don't carry over. So each round is a new allocation of 20 troops. So past rounds are for learning the opponent's tendencies.\n\nSo Beta's previous moves: Round 1: 8,8,4; Round 2:9,9,2. So Beta seems to be putting equal on A and B, and lower on C. In Round 1, C was 4; Round 2, C was 2. So maybe decreasing C? Or maybe in Round 1 it was a tie because both did same, but Round 2 Beta tried a different approach.\n\nWait, in Round 1, both did 8,8,4. So Beta mirrored me. Then in Round 2, I changed to 10,4,6, and Beta did 9,9,2. So perhaps Beta is reacting to my previous move.\n\nSo if in Round 1 I did 8,8,4, Beta copied. Then in Round 2, I did 10,4,6, Beta responded with 9,9,2. Maybe Beta is trying to match my high numbers but adjusted.\n\nHmm. So perhaps Beta's strategy is to put high on two fields, but in Round 2, they put 9 on A and B, but I had 10 on A, so they lost A, but had 9 on B vs my 4, so won B. Then C they had 2 vs my 6, lost C. So they only won one field.\n\nSo for Round 3, Beta might adjust. Maybe they will put more on C to prevent me from winning it again. Also, since I put 10 on A in Round 2, Beta might put 11 on A to beat me there. But they have to allocate 20 total.\n\nWait, if Beta decides to put 11 on A, then they have 9 left for B and C. If they split 5 and 4, for example. But then I need to counter that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta will go for a different distribution. Another common strategy is to do something like 7,7,6 to cover all fields moderately.\n\nBut since I need to win two fields, I should focus on two where I think Beta is weak.\n\nLooking at Beta's previous moves:\n\nRound 1: 8,8,4 (mirroring me)\n\nRound 2:9,9,2 (reducing C even more)\n\nSo maybe Beta is undervaluing C. In Round 2, they put only 2 on C, which was too low, and I had 6 there, so I won it. So if Beta continues to put low on C, I can keep putting moderate on C and win it. But maybe Beta realizes that and increases C.\n\nBut in Round 3, if I assume Beta might still undervalue C, perhaps putting 3 or 4 on C, then I could put 5 or 6 on C again. But I need to also win another field.\n\nIn Round 2, I won A with 10 vs 9. If Beta decides to put 11 on A next time, then my 10 would lose. So maybe I should either increase A more (but 11 would require others to be lower), or abandon A and focus on B and C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a different distribution. Let's think of possible allocations.\n\nI need x + y + z =20.\n\nSuppose I try to win B and C. If Beta is putting high on A and B (like 9,9,2), then in Round 2, they had 9 on B. If they do similar, putting say 8 on B, then if I put 9 on B, I can win it. But if Beta adjusts, maybe they put more on B.\n\nAlternatively, a common tactic is to do something like 5,5,10. Sacrifice two fields to win one big. But no, need to win two fields.\n\nWait, to win two fields, you need to have more than the opponent on two fields. So it's about having higher on two.\n\nSo perhaps a strategy is to have two fields where you have slightly more than expected, and sacrifice the third.\n\nGiven Beta's history: Round 1: 8,8,4; Round 2:9,9,2. So average on A: (8+9)/2=8.5, B: same, C: (4+2)/2=3. Maybe Beta's average is around 8.5,8.5,3.\n\nBut that might not be reliable. Alternatively, Beta seems to be decreasing C each time. Maybe Round 3 they put 0 or 1 on C? Unlikely, but possible.\n\nAlternatively, since in Round 2, Beta lost because C was too low, they might bump C up. Suppose they go to 5 on C. Then they have 15 left for A and B. Maybe 7 and 8.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAnother approach: in Blotto games, a common equilibrium is to randomize allocations. But since this is only Round 3, and we have observed two rounds, perhaps exploit the pattern.\n\nIn Round 1, tie with equal allocation. Round 2, I won by having more on A and C.\n\nSo Beta might try to cover C better. Let's say Beta does 8,7,5. Then to beat that, I need two fields higher.\n\nIf I do 9,6,5: then A:9>8, B:6<7, C:5=5 (tie?), depends on rules. If tie on a field, no one wins it. So need strict majority.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So I think you need to have more than the opponent on two fields. Ties on a field mean neither wins it, so you need two fields where you have strictly more.\n\nIn Round 1, all fields tied, so tie round.\n\nIn Round 2, I had A:10>9, B:4<9, C:6>2. So two wins, I won the round.\n\nSo for Round 3, I need to have two fields where my allocation > Beta's.\n\nGiven Beta's previous allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\n\nRound 2: A9 B9 C2\n\nSo Beta's C has been decreasing. Maybe Round 3 Beta does C0? But probably not, since they lost Round 2 because C was too low. So more likely, they increase C.\n\nSuppose Beta decides to put 6 on C. Then they have 14 left for A and B. Maybe split 7 and 7, or 8 and 6.\n\nIf Beta does A7 B7 C6.\n\nTo beat that, I need two fields higher. So if I do A8 B8 C4, then A:8>7, B:8>7, C:4<6. So win two fields. But wait, that's the Round 1 allocation.\n\nBut Beta might not do that. Alternatively, if Beta does A8 B6 C6.\n\nWait, this is too many possibilities.\n\nAlternative strategy: since in Round 2, Beta put 9 on A and B, perhaps they will continue to balance A and B. So maybe A and B around 8-9, C around 3-4.\n\nIf I assume Beta will put around 8 on A, 8 on B, 4 on C (like Round 1), but in Round 2 they did 9,9,2. Maybe they alternate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta is trying to do high on two fields, but which two?\n\nIn Round 1, they did high on A and B (8 each), medium on C (4). In Round 2, same, but C lower.\n\nSo likely, Beta is focusing on A and B, neglecting C.\n\nTherefore, if I put moderate on C (say 5-6), I can win C. Then I need to win either A or B.\n\nIn Round 2, I put 10 on A and won it. If Beta responds by putting 11 on A, then I need to either match or abandon A.\n\nBut if I abandon A, and focus on B and C.\n\nSuppose Beta does A11 B7 C2.\n\nIf I do A0 B10 C10. Then:\n\nA: 0 <11 (lose)\n\nB:10>7 (win)\n\nC:10>2 (win)\n\nSo win two fields. But is Beta likely to put 11 on A? Possibly, since they lost A in Round 2 by 10 vs 9.\n\nBut putting 11 on A would leave only 9 for B and C. If they do 11, 5,4 for example.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might spread more evenly.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that in previous rounds, the total on each field across both players can indicate something.\n\nBut maybe better to consider common Blotto strategies.\n\nA common Nash equilibrium in 3-field Blotto with total 20 is to randomize allocations such as (0,0,20), (0,20,0), (20,0,0), but that's for continuous, but with discrete it's different. However, in practice, players often use allocations like 4,8,8 or 6,6,8 etc.\n\nWait, but given the history, perhaps Beta is likely to repeat Round 2's strategy but adjust C upwards.\n\nRound 2: Beta did 9,9,2. Lost C because of 2. So maybe Round 3, Beta does 8,8,4 (like Round 1) or 7,7,6.\n\nIf Beta does 7,7,6.\n\nTo beat that, I need two fields higher than 7 and 6.\n\nFor example, 8,8,4: A8>7, B8>7, C4<6. Win two.\n\nBut if Beta does 8,8,4, then same as Round 1, tie.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does 6,6,8. Then if I do 7,7,6: A7>6, B7>6, C6<8. Win two.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, think about what I did last round. I did 10,4,6. Beta might think I'll do similar, so they might put 11 on A, 5 on B, 4 on C.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nIf I do 10,4,6 again:\n\nA:10 <11 → lose\n\nB:4 <5 → lose\n\nC:6 >4 → win\n\nOnly one win, lose the round.\n\nSo I need to adjust.\n\nIf I anticipate Beta going high on A (11), then I should not contest A. Instead, go high on B and C.\n\nFor example, A0 B11 C9. Total 20.\n\nIf Beta does A11 B5 C4:\n\nA:0 <11 (lose)\n\nB:11>5 (win)\n\nC:9>4 (win)\n\nWin two fields.\n\nBut is Beta likely to put 5 on B and 4 on C? If they put more on C, say C6, then C9>6 still wins.\n\nBut Beta might allocate differently.\n\nAnother possibility: Beta might think I will abandon A after Round 2, so they might not put as high on A.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe look for a allocation that covers multiple possibilities.\n\nWhat if I do 5, 5, 10. Sacrifice A and B, win C. But then I only win one field, which isn't enough. Need two.\n\nSo that's bad.\n\nHow about 7,7,6. Total 20.\n\nIf Beta did Round 2:9,9,2.\n\nAgainst 7,7,6:\n\nA:7 <9 (lose)\n\nB:7 <9 (lose)\n\nC:6 >2 (win)\n\nOnly one win. Not good.\n\nSo that's bad.\n\nIn Round 2, my 10,4,6 worked because Beta had 9,9,2.\n\nSo to replicate that success, I need Beta to have low on two fields.\n\nBut Beta will adjust.\n\nAlternative idea: vary the allocation to be unpredictable.\n\nSince in Round 1 I did 8,8,4; Round 2:10,4,6.\n\nFor Round 3, maybe do something like 4,10,6. Rotate where the high numbers go.\n\nBut Beta might not have a pattern yet.\n\nWait, if I do A4 B10 C6.\n\nIf Beta repeats Round 2's 9,9,2:\n\nA:4 <9 (lose)\n\nB:10>9 (win)\n\nC:6 >2 (win)\n\nWin two fields. Same as Round 2, just swapped A and B.\n\nBut Beta may not repeat 9,9,2. They might switch to defend B and C.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta anticipates I'll rotate, they might adjust.\n\nBut with only two data points, hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: the sum of both players' allocations per field.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, use a strategy that wins against both Round 1 and Round 2 allocations.\n\nRound 1 Beta: 8,8,4\n\nRound 2 Beta:9,9,2\n\nWhat allocation beats both?\n\nFor Round 1: need two fields >8,8,4.\n\nFor example, 9,9,2: but that's what Beta did Round 2. Wait:\n\nIf I do 9,9,2:\n\nvs Round 1 Beta (8,8,4):\n\nA:9>8, B:9>8, C:2<4 → win two.\n\nvs Round 2 Beta (9,9,2): tie all, which is bad.\n\nBut Round 3 Beta won't do the same as Round 2.\n\nAlternatively, find an allocation that beats both previous Beta allocations.\n\nTo beat 8,8,4: need two fields >8, or one >8 and one >4.\n\nTo beat 9,9,2: need two fields >9 or one >9 and one >2.\n\nWait, to beat 8,8,4, you could have 9,9,2 (as above).\n\nTo beat 9,9,2, need like 10,10,0 but total 20. 10,10,0:\n\nvs 8,8,4: A10>8, B10>8, C0<4 → win two.\n\nvs 9,9,2: A10>9, B10>9, C0<2 → win two.\n\nPerfect. But can I do 10,10,0? Total is 20.\n\nYes: A10 B10 C0.\n\nBut is this a good idea?\n\nIf Beta is doing something like 7,7,6:\n\nA10>7, B10>7, C0<6 → win two.\n\nIf Beta does 5,5,10:\n\nA10>5, B10>5, C0<10 → win two.\n\nWait, this seems strong. But the problem is that if Beta puts any on C, I lose C, but win A and B.\n\nBut if Beta decides to put 11 on A and 9 on B (total 20), but wait, 11+9=20, so C0.\n\nThen:\n\nA:10 <11 → lose\n\nB:10 <9? No, 10>9. Wait, 11 on A, 9 on B, C0.\n\nWait, 11+9+0=20.\n\nThen my A10 <11 (lose A), B10 >9 (win B), C0=0 (tie? Or lose? If both 0, it's a tie. But since I have 0 and Beta has 0, tie. So no win for C.\n\nSo then I only win B. Not enough.\n\nAh, so if Beta does 11,9,0, then I lose A, win B, tie C. So only one win.\n\nSo 10,10,0 is vulnerable if Beta concentrates on A.\n\nBut in previous rounds, Beta used C:4 and C:2, so maybe not likely to go C0.\n\nBut possible.\n\nAnother risk: if Beta does A0 B0 C20.\n\nThen my 10,10,0: lose A (10>0? Wait, no: if Beta has A0, I have A10, so I win A. Similarly B10>0. C0<20. So I win A and B. Still two wins.\n\nWait, yes. If Beta does all on C, I win A and B.\n\nSo 10,10,0 is good against many strategies.\n\nBut the problem is if Beta splits between A and B unevenly.\n\nLike Beta does 12,8,0.\n\nThen A:10<12 lose, B:10>8 win, C:0=0 tie. Only one win.\n\nSo it's risky.\n\nAlternative allocation: 9,9,2.\n\nWait, that's what Beta did Round 2.\n\nIf I do 9,9,2.\n\nAgainst Beta Round 1 (8,8,4): A9>8, B9>8, C2<4 → win two.\n\nAgainst Beta Round 2 (9,9,2): tie all.\n\nBut in Round 3, Beta likely won't do same.\n\nBut if Beta does something like 10,5,5.\n\nThen A9<10, B9>5, C2<5. Win only B. Bad.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: 7, 7, 6.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst Round 1 Beta (8,8,4): A7<8, B7<8, C6>4 → win only C. Bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nHow about 8, 7, 5.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst Round 1 Beta (8,8,4): A tie, B7<8, C5>4 → win C only. Bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, what if I do 11, 5, 4.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta (9,9,2): A11>9, B5<9, C4>2 → win A and C. Good.\n\nAgainst a hypothetical Beta Round 3 doing 10, 6, 4: A11>10, B5<6, C4=4 tie → win A only. Not good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, 12, 4, 4.\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta: A12>9, B4<9, C4>2 → win A and C.\n\nIf Beta increases A to 13, then A12<13, but they'd have 7 left for B and C. Say 4 and 3. Then B4=4 (tie?), C4>3. So win C only. Not good.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nWait, let's think of what worked in Round 2: I had 10,4,6 vs Beta's 9,9,2. So the key was having more on A and C.\n\nIf I assume Beta will still have relatively low on C, say <=5, then putting 6 on C would win it. Then I need to win one more field.\n\nIf I put 7 on A and 7 on B, but 7+7+6=20.\n\n[A7 B7 C6]\n\nAgainst Beta's possible 8,8,4: A7<8, B7<8, C6>4 → only C win. Bad.\n\nAgainst Beta's 9,9,2: A7<9, B7<9, C6>2 → only C win. Bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, so to win two fields, I need two fields where I have more. So if I focus on A and C:\n\nSuppose C needs 5 to win (assuming Beta does up to 4 on C).\n\nPut 5 on C. Then 15 left for A and B.\n\nIf I put 10 on A, 5 on B: [A10 B5 C5]\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta (9,9,2): A10>9, B5<9, C5>2 → win two. Good.\n\nIf Beta does Round 3 with A8 B8 C4: A10>8, B5<8, C5>4 → win two. Good.\n\nIf Beta does A11 B5 C4: A10<11, B5=5 (tie?), C5>4 → win C only. Not good.\n\nBut if Beta goes high on A, this fails.\n\nAlternative: [A9 B6 C5]\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta (9,9,2): A tie, B6<9, C5>2 → win C only. Bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, in Round 2, A was won with 10 vs 9. So to guarantee winning A, need at least 10 if Beta does 9. But if Beta does 10, need 11.\n\nBut it's a guessing game.\n\nPerhaps a safer approach is to do 9, 8, 3.\n\nWait:\n\n[A9 B8 C3]\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta (9,9,2): A tie, B8<9, C3>2 → win C only. Bad.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if I do [A6 B6 C8].\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta (9,9,2): A6<9, B6<9, C8>2 → win C only. Bad.\n\nNo.\n\nHow about [A5 B10 C5].\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta: A5<9, B10>9, C5>2 → win B and C. Good.\n\nIf Beta Round 3 does A8 B8 C4: A5<8, B10>8, C5>4 → win B and C. Good.\n\nIf Beta does A7 B7 C6: A5<7, B10>7, C5<6 → win B only. Bad.\n\nBut if C6, then C5 loses.\n\nSo if Beta increases C to 6, this fails.\n\nBut if Beta's history is decreasing C (4, then 2), maybe they won't jump to 6.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do C3 or 4.\n\nIn that case, C5 would win.\n\nAnother angle: the average allocation per field is about 6.66. So to win a field, need more than average.\n\nBut with two players, total 40 per field. Average per player is 20/3 ≈6.66 per field.\n\nSo to win a field, need >6.66, so at least 7.\n\nBut it's not necessarily the case, since allocations vary.\n\nIf I put 7 on two fields: 7,7,6.\n\nAs before, but against someone putting 8,8,4, I lose A and B.\n\nBut if Beta is putting more than 7 on two fields.\n\nWait, this is going in circles.\n\nLet's look for allocations that have worked historically or are common.\n\nIn Round 2, 10,4,6 worked. Maybe tweak it.\n\nSuppose I do [A9 B5 C6].\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst Round 2 Beta (9,9,2): A tie, B5<9, C6>2 → win only C. Bad.\n\nNot good.\n\n[A11 B3 C6].\n\nAgainst Round 2: A11>9, B3<9, C6>2 → win two. Good.\n\nIf Beta Round 3 does A12 B4 C4: A11<12, B3<4, C6>4 → win C only. Bad.\n\nBut if Beta does A10 B5 C5: A11>10, B3<5, C6>5 → win A and C. Good.\n\nThis allocation seems decent.\n\nAnother option: [A4 B10 C6] as I thought earlier.\n\nIf Beta does similar to Round 2 (9,9,2): A4<9, B10>9, C6>2 → win B and C. Good.\n\nIf Beta does A8 B8 C4: A4<8, B10>8, C6>4 → win B and C. Good.\n\nIf Beta does A5 B5 C10: A4<5, B10>5, C6<10 → win B only. Bad.\n\nBut Beta probably won't put 10 on C after losing with low C before.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do C5, so C6 wins.\n\nThis seems a solid choice.\n\nSo [A4 B10 C6].\n\nTotal 20.\n\nThis won Round 2 when I had A10 B4 C6; swapping A and B might exploit Beta's tendency to high A and B.\n\nSince in Round 2, Beta had high on A and B, by shifting my high to B and C, I can win those if Beta repeats.\n\nYes, this seems like a good plan.\n\nSo the allocation would be A4 B10 C6.\n",

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I'm Commander Beta in this Colonel Blotto game. We're on Round 3 now. So far, the first round was a tie where both of us put 8,8,4. Then in Round 2, Alpha did 10,4,6 and I did 9,9,2, which Alpha won because they won A (10 vs 9) and C (6 vs 2), so two fields. I only won B (9 vs 4). So now Alpha has 1 win, I have 0.\n\nI need to figure out how to allocate 20 troops across A, B, C for Round 3. The goal is to win two out of three battlefields. Let's analyze Alpha's previous moves to predict what they might do next.\n\nIn Round 1, Alpha used 8,8,4. Round 2, they switched to 10,4,6. Hmm, so maybe they're varying their strategy. Maybe they're trying to spread out or focus on different fields each time. Let me think about common strategies in Blotto games. Often, players might try to outguess each other by shifting resources. For example, if Alpha saw that in Round 2 I put a lot on B (9), they might under-allocate there next time, expecting me to do the same again.\n\nWait, in Round 2, I put 9 on B, which was higher than Alpha's 4, so I won B. But Alpha won A and C. So maybe for Round 3, Alpha might think I'll keep focusing on B again, so they might allocate more to B to counter me. Alternatively, maybe they think I'll shift to another field.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha is using a pattern. Round 1: balanced on A and B, less on C. Round 2: high on A, medium on C, low on B. Maybe they're rotating where they put their highest numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they're trying to exploit my previous allocations. In Round 1, I mirrored them (8,8,4). In Round 2, I did 9,9,2. So maybe Alpha is adjusting based on my moves.\n\nWait, in Round 1, since we tied, maybe Alpha expects me to change my strategy. In Round 2, I did 9,9,2, which lost because Alpha did 10,4,6. So for Round 3, I need to adjust.\n\nLet me think about possible strategies. One approach is to try to win two fields by concentrating on two. But since Alpha's moves vary, I need to anticipate.\n\nLooking at Round 2: Alpha did 10 on A, 4 on B, 6 on C. I did 9,9,2. So I lost A (10>9), won B (9>4), lost C (6>2). So to win two, I need to win two fields. Maybe next time, Alpha might lower A since they won it easily, or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will go high on B next time because I put 9 there last time. So if I put less on B now, maybe I can outmaneuver them.\n\nAlternatively, think about common Blotto strategies. Sometimes players use a \"guerrilla\" approach, putting minimal on one field and splitting the rest. Or maybe focusing on two fields.\n\nAnother angle: the total is 20. To win two fields, you need to have higher than opponent on two. So maybe I should allocate in a way that covers two fields where Alpha might be weak.\n\nBut since I don't know Alpha's move yet, I have to guess based on their history.\n\nAlpha's Round 1: 8,8,4. Round 2: 10,4,6.\n\nLooking at the numbers, in Round 1, they split evenly on A and B, less on C. Round 2, they went high on A, low on B, medium on C. Maybe they are shifting focus each round. Maybe Round 3 they might go high on C, medium on A, low on B? Or some other permutation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are using a strategy of putting the most on A first, then C, then B. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are reacting to my moves. In Round 1, I mirrored them. In Round 2, I did high on A and B, low on C. So they responded with 10 on A (beating my 9), low on B (but I had 9 there, so they lost B), and 6 on C (beating my 2). So maybe for Round 3, they might think I'll adjust by putting more on C, so they might lower C and put more elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should avoid symmetry. In Round 1, symmetry caused a tie. Round 2, I did 9,9,2 which was bad because Alpha did 10,4,6. So maybe for Round 3, I need a different distribution.\n\nLet me think of possible allocations. Let's say I try to win A and B. So I need to put more than Alpha on both. But since I don't know Alpha's allocation, I have to guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will put high on A again. In Round 2, they did 10 on A. Maybe they think I'll lower A, so they'll keep it high. If I put 11 on A, but that leaves 9 for B and C. But if Alpha does 10 again, 11 would win A. But if they lower A, maybe to 8, then 11 is overkill.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll shift to B. In Round 2, they put 4 on B, which was low. Maybe Round 3 they'll put more on B. So if I put less on B, but more on A and C.\n\nWait, let's think of possible strategies. A common one is to allocate 7,7,6 or something like that, but varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a strategy that covers two fields with moderate numbers. For example, 9 on A, 7 on B, 4 on C. But need to sum to 20.\n\nWait, let's think: If I put 10 on A, 7 on B, 3 on C. Sum is 20. If Alpha did something like 9,5,6, then I win A (10>9), lose B (7>5? Wait, 7>5 yes, so win B. Then C: 3<6. So win two. But depends on Alpha's move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will anticipate that and adjust.\n\nAlternatively, think about what Alpha did before. Round 1: 8,8,4. Round 2: 10,4,6. Maybe they are increasing A each time? From 8 to 10. Maybe Round 3 they do 12 on A? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they alternate. Round 1: high on A and B. Round 2: high on A and C. Round 3: high on B and C?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps they are using a rotating high value. Round 1: A and B at 8. Round 2: A at 10, C at 6. So maybe Round 3, B and C high?\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe a better approach is to use a mixed strategy to avoid predictability.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in Round 2, Alpha won by putting 10 on A, which beat my 9. So maybe for Round 3, they expect me to up my A allocation. So if I put 11 on A, but maybe Alpha puts 12 there, which would waste their troops if I don't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should under-allocate to A, expecting Alpha to go high there again, and focus on B and C.\n\nWait, in Round 2, Alpha put 10 on A, 4 on B, 6 on C. If I assume they might do similar, maybe lower A a bit but still high, like 9 on A, then maybe 5 on B and 6 on C? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will think I'll put more on C this time (since I lost C in Round 2 with 2), so they might lower C and put more on B.\n\nHmm. Let's try to think of a possible allocation. Suppose I do A:7, B:7, C:6. Sum 20. If Alpha does something like 8,8,4 again, then I lose A and B (7<8), win C (6>4). Only one win. Bad.\n\nIf Alpha does 10,4,6 as in Round 2: I have 7<10 (lose A), 7>4 (win B), 6=6 (tie C). So one win and a tie. Still not two wins.\n\nNot good. Maybe another allocation. Suppose I do A:10, B:6, C:4. If Alpha does 9,5,6: I win A (10>9), win B (6>5), lose C (4<6). Two wins. Good.\n\nBut if Alpha does 11,3,6: I lose A (10<11), win B (6>3), lose C. Only one win.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a safer bet is to spread more evenly but with a slight edge on two fields.\n\nWait, another approach: In Blotto, often the optimal strategy involves randomizing to prevent opponent from guessing. But since this is only Round 3, and we have history, maybe adjust based on previous.\n\nIn Round 1, both did 8,8,4. Tie.\n\nRound 2, Alpha did 10,4,6; I did 9,9,2. Alpha won.\n\nSo maybe for Round 3, Alpha might expect me to increase C (since I had 2 before and lost C), so they might decrease C and increase elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha might think I'll go for B again, so they might up B.\n\nWait, in Round 2, I put 9 on B and won it. So Alpha might allocate more to B in Round 3 to counter that. Suppose Alpha puts 8 on B. If I put 7 on B, but more on A and C.\n\nAlternatively, let's say I allocate A:8, B:5, C:7. Sum 20.\n\nIf Alpha does something like 9,8,3 (anticipating I'll do high B again), then:\n\nA:8 <9 → lose\n\nB:5 <8 → lose\n\nC:7 >3 → win. Only one win. Bad.\n\nAlternatively, if I do A:6, B:10, C:4.\n\nIf Alpha does 7, 8,5:\n\nA:6<7, B:10>8, C:4<5 → only B win. Not good.\n\nHmm. Maybe need to target two fields where Alpha is likely weak.\n\nLooking at Alpha's history: Round1: A8, B8, C4. Round2: A10, B4, C6.\n\nSo in Round1, C was low (4). Round2, C was 6. Maybe Round3, C could be higher? Or maybe Alpha alternates.\n\nAlternatively, the average per field is about 6.66. But allocations vary.\n\nAnother idea: In Round 2, Alpha's allocation sums to 20 (10+4+6=20). Round1 also 20.\n\nPerhaps Alpha is using a strategy of putting highest on A, then C, then B. Round1: A8, B8, C4 (but here A and B were equal). Round2: A10, C6, B4. So maybe Round3, they might do A something, B higher, C something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're shifting the highest value each round. Round1: A and B high. Round2: A high. Maybe Round3: B high?\n\nIf that's the case, then Alpha might put more on B in Round3. So if I anticipate that, I should either match B or avoid it.\n\nIf I think Alpha will go high on B, then I can either:\n\n1. Also go high on B to compete, and try to win another field.\n\n2. Let B go and win A and C.\n\nOption 2 might be better if I can secure A and C with moderate numbers.\n\nSuppose Alpha does high on B, say 10 on B. Then they have 10 left for A and C.\n\nIf I allocate A:9, B:4, C:7.\n\nIf Alpha does A:5, B:10, C:5.\n\nThen:\n\nA:9>5 → win\n\nB:4<10 → lose\n\nC:7>5 → win. Two wins. Good.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, another common strategy is to do 7, 7, 6. But sum is 20? 7+7+6=20. Yes.\n\nIf I do A7, B7, C6.\n\nAgainst Alpha's possible moves:\n\nIf Alpha does A8, B8, C4 (like Round1), then:\n\nA:7<8, B:7<8, C:6>4 → only C win. Bad.\n\nIf Alpha does A10, B4, C6 (Round2):\n\nA:7<10, B:7>4, C:6=6 → B win and tie C. Only one win. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Since in Round2, Alpha beat my C allocation (I had 2, they had 6), maybe they expect me to increase C. So they might lower C and put more on A or B.\n\nSuppose I do A:8, B:8, C:4 again. But that's what we did Round1 and tied. Not good, since Alpha might vary.\n\nWait, but if I do something different. Let's think of A:5, B:10, C:5.\n\nIf Alpha expects me to up C, and they lower C to 3, say A:9, B:5, C:6.\n\nThen:\n\nA:5<9, B:10>5, C:5<6. Only B win. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, A:9, B:5, C:6.\n\nIf Alpha does A:8, B:10, C:2.\n\nThen A:9>8, B:5<10, C:6>2. Two wins. Good.\n\nBut depends on Alpha's move.\n\nThis is really about guessing. Maybe a better approach is to use a strategy that has worked in similar situations.\n\nIn Blotto games, a common effective strategy is to allocate troops such that you have two fields with allocations just above the expected minimums.\n\nAlternatively, think about the previous rounds. In Round1, both had 8,8,4. Tie.\n\nRound2, Alpha shifted to 10,4,6; I did 9,9,2 and lost.\n\nSo maybe Alpha is trying to vary where they place their highest number. Round1: two fields high. Round2: one field very high (A), one medium (C), one low (B).\n\nPerhaps Round3, they'll have high on B and C, low on A.\n\nIf that's the case, I should put more on A and one other.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A:4, B:10, C:6.\n\nIf I do A:5, B:9, C:6.\n\nThen A:5>4, B:9<10, C:6=6. Win A, tie C. Only one win. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, A:7, B:7, C:6.\n\nAgainst A:4, B:10, C:6: A win, B lose, C tie. Still only one win.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative plan: Sacrifice one field and win the other two.\n\nSuppose I decide to sacrifice B, so put minimal there, say 0 or 1, and split 20 between A and C.\n\nBut putting 0 might be risky if Alpha also puts low there. But in Blotto, you can have zeros.\n\nWait, the problem states \"each ≥0\", so zeros are allowed.\n\nFor example, A:10, B:0, C:10.\n\nIf Alpha does something like A:9, B:8, C:3.\n\nThen A:10>9, B:0<8, C:10>3. Win A and C. Good.\n\nBut if Alpha does A:11, B:1, C:8.\n\nThen A:10<11, B:0<1 (but wait, B:0 vs 1, so lose B), C:10>8. Only C win. Bad.\n\nSo sacrificing a field is risky unless you're sure.\n\nAlternatively, put 1 on B, 10 on A, 9 on C.\n\nSum 20.\n\nIf Alpha does A:9, B:5, C:6.\n\nA:10>9, B:1<5, C:9>6. Win A and C. Good.\n\nBut if Alpha does A:11, B:1, C:8.\n\nA:10<11, B:1=1 (tie?), but in Blotto usually higher wins, tie goes to no one. So if equal, it's a tie for that field.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So to win a battlefield, you need strictly more than opponent.\n\nSo ties on a field mean no one wins that field.\n\nTherefore, in the game, to get two wins, you need two fields where you have strictly more.\n\nSo in the example where allocations are equal on a field, that field is not won by either.\n\nSo going back, if I do A:10, B:1, C:9.\n\nIf Alpha does A:10, B:2, C:8.\n\nThen A ties, B I lose (1<2), C I win (9>8). Only one win.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Use the fact that in Round2, Alpha did 4 on B. Maybe they think I'll go high on B again, so they'll allocate more to B. So if I do moderate on B and higher on A and C.\n\nSuppose I do A:8, B:6, C:6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nIf Alpha allocates expecting high B: say A:7, B:10, C:3.\n\nThen:\n\nA:8>7, B:6<10, C:6>3. Win A and C. Good.\n\nIf Alpha does Round1 style: 8,8,4.\n\nA:8=8 (tie), B:6<8, C:6>4. Win C only. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Not great.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at the difference between our allocations in Round2.\n\nAlpha: 10,4,6\n\nMe:9,9,2\n\nSo I lost A by 1, won B by 5, lost C by 4.\n\nMaybe for Round3, Alpha might adjust to shore up where they lost. They lost B, so they might increase B.\n\nSuppose Alpha increases B to 8, then allocates remaining 12 to A and C.\n\nE.g., A:7, B:8, C:5.\n\nIf I anticipate that, I could do A:8, B:7, C:5.\n\nThen:\n\nA:8>7, B:7<8, C:5=5. Win A only. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, if I do A:6, B:9, C:5.\n\nAgainst A:7, B:8, C:5:\n\nA:6<7, B:9>8, C:5=5. Win B only.\n\nStill no good.\n\nWait, maybe I need to win two fields by having allocations just above likely Alpha's.\n\nIf I think Alpha will put around 8 on B (since they lost it last time with 4), then to win B I need >8, say 9.\n\nBut then remaining 11 for A and C.\n\nSuppose I do A:6, B:9, C:5.\n\nIf Alpha does A:8, B:8, C:4.\n\nThen:\n\nA:6<8, B:9>8, C:5>4. Win B and C. Good.\n\nIf Alpha does A:9, B:7, C:4.\n\nA:6<9, B:9>7, C:5>4. Win B and C.\n\nIf Alpha does A:5, B:10, C:5.\n\nA:6>5, B:9<10, C:5=5. Win A only.\n\nHmm, depends.\n\nAlternatively, A:7, B:9, C:4.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's possible A:8, B:8, C:4:\n\nA:7<8, B:9>8, C:4=4. Win B only.\n\nNot good.\n\nAgainst A:9, B:4, C:6 (Round2 style):\n\nA:7<9, B:9>4, C:4<6. Win B only.\n\nStill only one.\n\nNeed two wins.\n\nWait, maybe A:10, B:7, C:3.\n\nIf Alpha does A:9, B:8, C:3:\n\nA:10>9, B:7<8, C:3=3. Win A only.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf Alpha does A:8, B:6, C:6:\n\nA:10>8, B:7>6, C:3<6. Win A and B. Good.\n\nBut if Alpha does A:11, B:5, C:4:\n\nA:10<11, B:7>5, C:3<4. Win B only.\n\nRisky.\n\nAlternative idea inspired by Round2: Alpha beat my C with 6 when I had 2. So maybe they expect me to increase C. If I do increase C to, say, 5 or 6, but they lower C to 3 or 4.\n\nSuppose I do A:8, B:7, C:5.\n\nIf Alpha lowers C to 3, and does A:9, B:8, C:3.\n\nThen:\n\nA:8<9, B:7<8, C:5>3. Win C only.\n\nBad.\n\nAlternatively, if I do A:9, B:6, C:5.\n\nAgainst A:8, B:7, C:5:\n\nA:9>8, B:6<7, C:5=5. Win A only.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the fact that in two rounds, Alpha's allocations for each field:\n\nA: 8, 10 → average about 9\n\nB:8,4 → average 6\n\nC:4,6 → average 5\n\nBut not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha's strategy is to allocate in a way similar to previous but shifted. Round1: 8,8,4. Round2: 10,4,6 (increased A by 2, decreased B by 4, increased C by 2). Not obvious pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as Alpha trying to beat my previous move.\n\nIn Round1, I did 8,8,4 (same as Alpha). Round2, I did 9,9,2. Alpha responded with 10,4,6 which beats me on A and C.\n\nSo for Round3, if Alpha anticipates I'll adjust from 9,9,2, maybe I'll increase C. So Alpha might lower C and put more on B.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A:9, B:7, C:4.\n\nIf I do A:8, B:8, C:4. Wait, sum is 20.\n\nAgainst A:9, B:7, C:4:\n\nA:8<9, B:8>7, C:4=4. Win B only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf I do A:10, B:6, C:4.\n\nAgainst A:9, B:7, C:4:\n\nA:10>9, B:6<7, C:4=4. Win A only.\n\nStill no.\n\nWait, need to win two. Let's say I target A and B.\n\nNeed > Alpha's A and > Alpha's B.\n\nAssume Alpha might do A:8, B:7, C:5.\n\nIf I do A:9, B:8, C:3.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst A:8, B:7, C:5: Win A and B. Good.\n\nIf Alpha does A:9, B:6, C:5:\n\nA:9=9, B:8>6, C:3<5. Win B only.\n\nTie on A.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, A:10, B:7, C:3.\n\nAgainst A:9, B:6, C:5: Win A and B. C lose.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst A:11, B:5, C:4: Lose A, win B, lose C. Only B.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe a more balanced approach.\n\nHow about A:7, B:7, C:6.\n\nWait, sum is 20.\n\nIf Alpha does something like A:6, B:8, C:6.\n\nThen:\n\nA:7>6, B:7<8, C:6=6. Win A only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf Alpha does A:8, B:5, C:7.\n\nA:7<8, B:7>5, C:6<7. Win B only.\n\nStill one.\n\nWait, what if I do A:5, B:10, C:5.\n\nIf Alpha does A:4, B:9, C:7.\n\nA:5>4, B:10>9, C:5<7. Win A and B. Good.\n\nBut if Alpha does A:6, B:8, C:6.\n\nA:5<6, B:10>8, C:5<6. Win B only.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: Look for allocations where two numbers are higher than likely Alpha's.\n\nSince Alpha's B allocations were 8 and 4, maybe average around 6. So if I put 7 on B.\n\nSimilarly, A was 8 and 10, average 9. So maybe 8 or 9 on A.\n\nC was 4 and 6, average 5. So 6 on C.\n\nSo A:8, B:7, C:5. Sum 20.\n\nIf Alpha does A:9, B:6, C:5.\n\nA:8<9, B:7>6, C:5=5. Win B only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf Alpha does A:7, B:8, C:5.\n\nA:8>7, B:7<8, C:5=5. Win A only.\n\nStill one.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I do A:9, B:5, C:6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Round1 Alpha (8,8,4):\n\nA:9>8, B:5<8, C:6>4. Win A and C. Good.\n\nAgainst Round2 Alpha (10,4,6):\n\nA:9<10, B:5>4, C:6=6. Win B only.\n\nAh, so against Round2 allocation, only one win. But maybe Alpha won't repeat Round2.\n\nIf Alpha changes, maybe this works.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha does something like A:8, B:6, C:6.\n\nThen A:9>8, B:5<6, C:6=6. Win A only.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother angle: In order to win two fields, the sum of the two smallest allocations on your side should be more than the sum of the two smallest on opponent's? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe think in terms of common splits. A known equilibrium strategy for 3 fields and total 20 might involve allocations like 7,7,6 but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another thought. In Round2, when I did 9,9,2, I lost because Alpha did 10,4,6. So they beat me on A and C.\n\nIf I want to avoid that, maybe I should not have two high numbers. Maybe spread more evenly but with two fields covered.\n\nWait, what if I do A:7, B:8, C:5.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's Round2 (10,4,6):\n\nA:7<10, B:8>4, C:5<6. Win B only.\n\nNot good.\n\nAgainst hypothetical Alpha Round3: A:9, B:7, C:4.\n\nA:7<9, B:8>7, C:5>4. Win B and C. Good.\n\nSo this allocation could work if Alpha does medium on A.\n\nBut it's all guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, consider that Alpha won Round2 by putting 10 on A. Maybe they'll lower A a bit but still keep it high. Say A:9.\n\nAnd since they lost B with 4, maybe increase B to 6 or 7.\n\nC might be around 5.\n\nSo Alpha: A:9, B:6, C:5.\n\nIf I do A:10, B:7, C:3.\n\nThen win A and B.\n\nBut sum is 20.\n\nAgainst that Alpha allocation: yes.\n\nIf Alpha actually does A:8, B:7, C:5.\n\nMy A:10>8, B:7=7 (tie), C:3<5. Win A only.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another strategy: Use 8 on two fields and 4 on the third, but vary which field gets 4.\n\nIn Round1, Alpha and I both did C:4.\n\nIn Round2, Alpha did B:4.\n\nSo maybe Round3, Alpha might do A:4.\n\nIf that's the case, then I should load up on A.\n\nSo if Alpha does A:4, B:10, C:6.\n\nIf I do A:5, B:9, C:6.\n\nThen A:5>4, B:9<10, C:6=6. Win A only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf I do A:10, B:5, C:5.\n\nAgainst A:4, B:10, C:6:\n\nA:10>4, B:5<10, C:5<6. Win A only.\n\nStill one.\n\nIf I do A:5, B:8, C:7.\n\nAgainst A:4, B:10, C:6:\n\nA:5>4, B:8<10, C:7>6. Win A and C. Good.\n\nSum is 20.\n\nSo this could work if Alpha sacrifices A.\n\nBut is Alpha likely to do that?\n\nGiven that in Round1 they had A:8, Round2 A:10, maybe they won't go as low as 4 on A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not.\n\nThis is really hard without more data.\n\nGiven that it's Round3, and I need to catch up (0-1), I should try an allocation that could win two fields against likely Alpha responses.\n\nLet me try to pick A:7, B:6, C:7. Sum 20.\n\nWait, 7+6+7=20.\n\nAgainst Round1 Alpha (8,8,4):\n\nA:7<8, B:6<8, C:7>4. Win C only.\n\nBad.\n\nAgainst Round2 Alpha (10,4,6):\n\nA:7<10, B:6>4, C:7>6. Win B and C. Good.\n\nAh, this would have won Round2 if I had done this.\n\nIn Round2, I did 9,9,2 and lost. But if I had done 7,6,7, I would have won B and C.\n\nGiven that, maybe Alpha expects others to learn from previous rounds. So for Round3, they might adjust knowing that putting 4 on B is risky.\n\nSo perhaps Alpha will increase B.\n\nSuppose Alpha Round3: A:9, B:7, C:4.\n\nIf I do A:8, B:8, C:4. Wait, sum is 20.\n\nAgainst A:9, B:7, C:4:\n\nA:8<9, B:8>7, C:4=4. Win B only.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I do A:7, B:7, C:6.\n\nAgainst A:9, B:7, C:4:\n\nA:7<9, B:7=7, C:6>4. Win C only.\n\nStill one.\n\nWait, going back to the idea that if in Round2, Alpha did 10,4,6, and I could have won with 7,6,7. Maybe Alpha anticipates that players might do medium allocations on B and C.\n\nSo for Round3, Alpha might put more on B and C.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A:6, B:8, C:6.\n\nIf I do A:7, B:7, C:6.\n\nThen A:7>6, B:7<8, C:6=6. Win A only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf I do A:5, B:9, C:6.\n\nAgainst A:6, B:8, C:6:\n\nA:5<6, B:9>8, C:6=6. Win B only.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I try A:6, B:10, C:4.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst hypothetical Alpha A:7, B:7, C:6:\n\nA:6<7, B:10>7, C:4<6. Win B only.\n\nAgainst Alpha A:5, B:9, C:6:\n\nA:6>5, B:10>9, C:4<6. Win A and B. Good.\n\nBut if Alpha does A:8, B:6, C:6:\n\nA:6<8, B:10>6, C:4<6. Win B only.\n\nIt's hit or miss.\n\nAlternative plan: Randomly choose between a few strong allocations.\n\nBut since I have to pick one, let's think of what would beat common allocations.\n\nAn allocation like A:8, B:7, C:5.\n\nSum 20.\n\nIf Alpha does something like A:7, B:8, C:5 → I win A, lose B, tie C → one win.\n\nIf Alpha does A:9, B:5, C:6 → I lose A, win B, lose C → one win.\n\nNot great.\n\nWait, another idea. In game theory, for Blotto with 3 fields and total n, often the strategy involves permutations of (a, b, c) where a > b > c and a+b+c=total.\n\nBut I need to choose one.\n\nWait, let's look up common Blotto strategies mentally. For symmetric games, sometimes splitting as evenly as possible but with slight variations.\n\nBut since we're at 20, which is divisible by... 20 divided by 3 is ~6.66.\n\nSo maybe 7,7,6.\n\nAs I thought before.\n\nIf I do A:7, B:7, C:6.\n\nAgainst Alpha's Round2 (10,4,6): I get B win (7>4), C tie (6=6), A loss. So one win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nBut if Alpha changes.\n\nSuppose Alpha Round3 is A:8, B:5, C:7.\n\nThen:\n\nA:7<8, B:7>5, C:6<7. Win B only.\n\nStill one.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I do A:9, B:6, C:5.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha possibly doing A:8, B:7, C:5:\n\nA:9>8, B:6<7, C:5=5. Win A only.\n\nAgainst A:10, B:4, C:6:\n\nA:9<10, B:6>4, C:5<6. Win B only.\n\nStill one.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, maybe go extreme. Sacrifice A completely.\n\nA:0, B:10, C:10.\n\nIf Alpha does A:5, B:5, C:10.\n\nA:0<5, B:10>5, C:10=10. Win B only.\n\nIf Alpha does A:8, B:6, C:6.\n\nA:0<8, B:10>6, C:10>6. Win B and C. Good.\n\nBut if Alpha anticipates sacrifice of A, they might do A:0 or low.\n\nBut putting 0 on A is risky if Alpha also puts low on A.\n\nWait, if both put 0 on A, then it's a tie, no one wins A.\n\nSo if I do A:0, B:10, C:10.\n\nAlpha does A:1, B:9, C:10.\n\nThen A:0<1, B:10>9, C:10=10. Win B only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, A:1, B:9, C:10.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha A:0, B:10, C:10.\n\nA:1>0, B:9<10, C:10=10. Win A only.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nThis is really tough.\n\nWait, going back to Round2 analysis. When I did 9,9,2, I lost because Alpha did 10,4,6.\n\nSo to beat that kind of allocation, what should I have done?\n\nTo beat 10,4,6, I need >10 on A (11+), or >4 on B and >6 on C.\n\nBut with 20 troops, doing 11 on A leaves 9 for B and C. To win both B and C against 4 and 6, I'd need at least 5 on B and 7 on C, which sums to 12. But 11+12=23 >20. Impossible.\n\nSo the way to beat 10,4,6 is to win A and one other, or B and C.\n\nTo win A: need ≥11.\n\nTo win B and C: need ≥5 on B and ≥7 on C. 5+7=12. So 11 on A would be 11+5+4=20, but then C is 4 <6. Doesn't work.\n\nWait, 5 on B (to beat 4), 7 on C (to beat 6). Total 12. So A would be 8.\n\nSo A:8, B:5, C:7.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst 10,4,6:\n\nA:8<10, B:5>4, C:7>6. Win B and C. Perfect.\n\nAh! So in Round2, if I had done 8,5,7 instead of 9,9,2, I would have won.\n\nSo maybe for Round3, Alpha might anticipate that players would learn to do something like 8,5,7 against their Round2 allocation.\n\nTherefore, Alpha might adjust to prevent that.\n\nSo if Alpha thinks I'll do 8,5,7 to win B and C, they might increase B and/or C.\n\nFor example, if Alpha does A:9, B:6, C:5.\n\nThen:\n\nAgainst my hypothetical 8,5,7:\n\nA:8<9, B:5<6, C:7>5. Win C only.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo Alpha might rebalance to have higher B and lower C.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha might do A:9, B:5, C:6.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWait, let's see. If I plan to do 8,5,7 for Round3.\n\nWhat would Alpha need to do to counter?\n\nTo prevent me from winning B and C, they need to have B ≥5 or C ≥7.\n\nWait, to stop me winning B: Alpha's B ≥5+1=6? No, to beat my B:5, Alpha needs B ≥6.\n\nSimilarly, to beat my C:7, Alpha needs C ≥8.\n\nBut if Alpha focuses on upping C to 8, then A and B would be lower.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A:8, B:4, C:8.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst my 8,5,7:\n\nA:8=8, B:5>4, C:7<8. Win B only.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha does A:10, B:5, C:5.\n\nAgainst my 8,5,7:\n\nA:8<10, B:5=5, C:7>5. Win C only.\n\nStill one.\n\nHmm.\n\nBut if I do 8,5,7, and Alpha doesn't adjust much, I could win.\n\nGiven that this would have beaten Round2's allocation, maybe it's a good guess for Round3.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha might have increased B to 6.\n\nSo if Alpha does A:9, B:6, C:5.\n\nAgainst 8,5,7: lose A, lose B, win C. One win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nBut if I increase B to 6.\n\nA:8, B:6, C:6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha A:9, B:6, C:5:\n\nA:8<9, B:6=6, C:6>5. Win C only.\n\nStill one.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I do A:7, B:6, C:7.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha A:8, B:5, C:7:\n\nA:7<8, B:6>5, C:7=7. Win B only.\n\nAgainst Alpha A:9, B:7, C:4:\n\nA:7<9, B:6<7, C:7>4. Win C only.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nBack to the idea that to beat the previous Alpha allocation (10,4,6), the correct response is (8,5,7). So maybe Alpha will change to counter that.\n\nHow would Alpha counter (8,5,7)?\n\nThey need to win at least two fields.\n\nSo:\n\n- To beat A:8, do A≥9\n\n- To beat B:5, do B≥6\n\n- To beat C:7, do C≥8\n\nAlpha needs to choose two of these.\n\nFor example, A:9, B:6, C:5. Wins A and B.\n\nOr A:9, C:8, B:3. Wins A and C.\n\nOr B:6, C:8, A:6. Wins B and C.\n\nSo depending on what Alpha chooses.\n\nIf I anticipate that Alpha will go for A and B (A:9, B:6, C:5), then to counter I need to win two fields against that.\n\nIf I do A:10, B:7, C:3.\n\nAgainst A:9, B:6, C:5: Win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nBut sum is 20.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha goes for A and C, say A:9, C:8, B:3.\n\nIf I do A:10, B:4, C:6.\n\nWin A and C.\n\nBut again, speculative.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted. Given the time I've spent, I need to pick a reasonable allocation.\n\nGiven that in Round2, the winning strategy against Alpha's move would have been 8,5,7, and Alpha might adjust, but perhaps not fully.\n\nMaybe a safe choice is to do 8,5,7.\n\nOr slightly tweak it to 8,6,6 which sums to 20.\n\nWait, 8+6+6=20.\n\nAgainst Round2 Alpha (10,4,6):\n\nA:8<10, B:6>4, C:6=6. Win B only.\n\nNot as good as 8,5,7 which would win B and C.\n\nAh, right. 8,5,7 sums to 20.\n\n8+5+7=20.\n\nYes.\n\nSo 8 on A, 5 on B, 7 on C.\n\nAgainst Round2 allocation: win B and C.\n\nIf Alpha changes slightly, maybe still win two.\n\nFor example, if Alpha does A:9, B:5, C:6.\n\nThen:\n\nA:8<9, B:5=5, C:7>6. Win C only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nBut if Alpha does A:8, B:6, C:6.\n\nA:8=8, B:5<6, C:7>6. Win C only.\n\nStill one.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, increase B to 6, so A:7, B:6, C:7.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha A:8, B:6, C:6:\n\nA:7<8, B:6=6, C:7>6. Win C only.\n\nAgainst Alpha A:9, B:5, C:6:\n\nA:7<9, B:6>5, C:7>6. Win B and C. Good.\n\nSo this allocation (7,6,7) could work if Alpha keeps B low.\n\nGiven that in Round2 Alpha had B:4, which is low, maybe they increase it a bit but not too much.\n\nIf Alpha does B:5 or 6, then 6 or 7 on B could win.\n\nGiven all this, I think 7,6,7 is a reasonable guess.\n\nSo A:7, B:6, C:7.\n\nBut wait, sum is 7+6+7=20. Yes.\n\nOutput format: [A7 B6 C7]\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nYes, 7+6+7=20.\n\nAgainst Round2's 10,4,6: B:6>4, C:7>6. Win two. Good.\n\nAgainst a slightly adjusted Alpha, say A:9, B:5, C:6: B:6>5, C:7>6. Win two.\n\nIf Alpha does A:8, B:7, C:5: A:7<8, B:6<7, C:7>5. Win C only. Bad.\n\nBut hopefully, Alpha doesn't go high on B.\n\nGiven that in Round2 they lost B with 4, they might increase B but maybe not all the way to 7.\n\nIf they do B:6, then my B:6 ties, so need to win elsewhere.\n\nBut if C is 5, then C:7>5.\n\nSo allocation 7,6,7 seems decent.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how to allocate 20 troops across A, B, and C for Round 4 of Colonel Blotto. So far, the game has had three rounds.\n\nRound 1 was a tie: both players did A8 B8 C4.\nRound 2, I (Commander Alpha) did A10 B4 C6 and won because Beta did A9 B9 C2. So I won A and C, Beta won B.\nRound 3, I did A4 B10 C6 but Beta did A7 B6 C7. So Beta won A and C, I won B. So Beta won that round.\n\nNow it's Round 4, and the score is 1-1. I need to strategize for this next round.\n\nFirst, I should look for patterns in Beta's allocations. Let's list out what Beta has done so far:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\nRound 2: A9 B9 C2\nRound 3: A7 B6 C7\n\nHmm. In Round 1, Beta spread evenly with a bit less on C. Round 2, high on A and B, very low on C. Round 3, more balanced but higher on A and C.\n\nMaybe Beta is varying their strategy, but perhaps there's a tendency. Let's see the averages:\n\nA: (8 +9 +7)/3 = 24/3 = 8\nB: (8 +9 +6)/3 = 23/3 ≈7.67\nC: (4 +2 +7)/3 =13/3 ≈4.33\n\nBut averages might not be the best approach. Alternatively, looking for what Beta might expect me to do.\n\nIn Round 2, I used A10 B4 C6 and won. Then in Round 3, I switched to A4 B10 C6 and lost. So Beta might anticipate me switching again.\n\nIn Round 3, Beta put 7 on A and 7 on C. So maybe Beta is trying to cover both A and C.\n\nI need to win two battlefields. Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nOne approach is to focus on two fields, putting more troops there, and minimal on the third. But need to guess which two Beta will under-allocate.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Beta's past moves:\n\nRound 1: C was 4, which was low. So in Round 2, I put 6 on C and won C because Beta had 2. But in Round 3, Beta put 7 on C, so my 6 lost.\n\nSimilarly, in Round 2, Beta had 9 on A and 9 on B, but I had 10 on A so won A, and 4 on B which lost to Beta's 9. Then C I had 6 vs Beta's 2, so won C.\n\nIn Round 3, Beta had 7 on A, I had 4 which lost. B I had 10 vs Beta's 6, so won B. C I had 6 vs Beta's 7, lost. So Beta won A and C.\n\nSo for Round 4, I need to pick two fields where I can have higher than Beta's allocation.\n\nPossible Beta strategies:\n\n- If Beta expects me to go high on B again (like Round 3), they might put more on B.\n- Or if they think I'll mimic Round 2 (high A, low B), they might adjust.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might try to balance more.\n\nAnother angle: In Round 1, both did same. Round 2, I did A10 B4 C6, Beta did A9 B9 C2. So Beta might have thought I'd spread more, but I concentrated on A and C.\n\nRound 3, I did A4 B10 C6, Beta did A7 B6 C7. So Beta covered A and C, leaving B lower but not enough to beat my 10.\n\nSo for Round 4, Beta might anticipate me switching again, perhaps going high on C or something.\n\nWait, let's see the pattern of Beta's allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\nRound 2: A9 B9 C2 (C very low)\nRound 3: A7 B6 C7 (C high again)\n\nSo Beta's C allocation: 4, 2, 7. So it's varying. Maybe Beta is trying to sometimes neglect C, sometimes focus.\n\nSimilarly, A: 8,9,7. So around 8.\n\nB: 8,9,6. So decreasing?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAnother approach: In Blotto games, common strategies include splitting into 8-8-4, 10-6-4, 7-7-6, etc.\n\nSince the total is 20, possible common splits.\n\nBut since we've seen some patterns, perhaps Beta is using a strategy where they sometimes put low on one field.\n\nIn Round 2, Beta put 2 on C, so I won C with 6.\n\nIn Round 3, Beta put 7 on C, which beat my 6.\n\nSo maybe for Round 4, Beta might put a moderate amount on C again.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might go low on B, since in Round 2 they had 9 on B, Round 3 had 6. Maybe Round 4 they go lower on B.\n\nWait, in Round 3, Beta had B6, which lost to my B10. So maybe Beta will increase B in Round 4 to counter.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about what I did in previous rounds:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\n\nRound 2: A10 B4 C6\n\nRound 3: A4 B10 C6\n\nSo my allocations have been varying. Round 1 balanced, Round 2 high A, low B, Round 3 low A, high B.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is trying to predict my next move. If I continue the pattern, maybe Round 4 would be high C? Like A4 B4 C12? But that's risky.\n\nBut 12 on C might be too much if Beta also goes high on C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta expects me to go high on C, so they might allocate more to C.\n\nAlternatively, think of what fields Beta has been winning:\n\nRound 1: Tie all.\n\nRound 2: Beta won B (9 vs my 4), but I won A and C.\n\nRound 3: Beta won A and C (7 vs 4, 7 vs6), I won B.\n\nSo Beta's winning fields: B in Round 2, A and C in Round 3.\n\nSo maybe Beta is shifting focus.\n\nAnother angle: To win two fields, I need to have higher in two.\n\nSuppose I choose to go high on A and B, low on C.\n\nOr high on A and C, low on B.\n\nOr high on B and C.\n\nBut need to guess where Beta is weak.\n\nLooking at Beta's allocations:\n\nRound 1: C4\n\nRound 2: C2\n\nRound 3: C7\n\nSo C was low in first two rounds, then high in third. Maybe Round 4 they go low again? Or maybe not.\n\nIf I put high on C (like 8 or more), but if Beta also puts high, then maybe split.\n\nAlternatively, if I put 10 on C, but then have 10 left for A and B.\n\nWait, total 20. Let's consider possible allocations.\n\nSuppose I do A7 B7 C6. Balanced, but maybe not enough to win two.\n\nAlternatively, A9 B9 C2. But in Round 2, Beta did that, and I beat them by having A10.\n\nBut if I do A9 B9 C2, and Beta does something else.\n\nWait, but I need to choose based on Beta's tendencies.\n\nAnother thought: In Round 2, Beta had C2, so I won C with 6. In Round 3, Beta had C7, so my 6 lost. So maybe Beta alternates low and high on C.\n\nIf Round 4, Beta might go low on C again (like Round 1 and 2), then I should put more on C.\n\nWait Round 1: C4 (Beta), Round 2: C2, Round 3: C7. So not a clear alternation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta's C is random.\n\nAlternatively, think about the fact that in Round 3, Beta won by having higher on A and C. So maybe Beta will try to do similar again, but adjust.\n\nWait, in Round 3, Beta did A7 B6 C7. So they focused on A and C.\n\nIf Beta thinks I'll go high on B again (like Round 3), they might lower B and focus on A and C again.\n\nSo if I go high on B, but Beta also lowers B, then I could win B with a moderate number.\n\nWait, but in Round 3, I put 10 on B and Beta put 6. If Beta anticipates that, they might put more on B in Round 4.\n\nAlternatively, they might think I'll switch, so they'll adjust.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should go for a strategy that covers two fields where Beta might be weak.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the most common allocations in Blotto games. For 20 units over 3 fields, typical strategies might be 8-8-4, 9-7-4, 10-6-4, 7-7-6.\n\nSince in Round 1, both did 8-8-4.\n\nRound 2, I did 10-4-6, Beta did 9-9-2.\n\nRound 3, I did 4-10-6, Beta did 7-6-7.\n\nPerhaps Beta is varying but tends to put lower on one field each round.\n\nRound 1: C4 (low)\n\nRound 2: C2 (very low)\n\nRound 3: B6 (lower than A and C)\n\nSo in Round 4, maybe Beta will put low on A?\n\nIf Beta puts low on A, then I should put high on A.\n\nBut how to guess.\n\nAlternatively, since in Round 3, Beta had A7, which beat my A4. If they think I'll go low on A again, they might keep A moderate.\n\nWait, in Round 2, my A10 beat their A9.\n\nRound 3, their A7 beat my A4.\n\nSo if I go A8 this round, and Beta puts A7, I win A. If Beta puts A8 or higher, then depends.\n\nAlternatively, if I put A9, which is higher than their Round 3 A7.\n\nBut I need to balance.\n\nAnother idea: Since in Round 3, Beta used A7 B6 C7, which sums to 20. So they did two 7s and a 6.\n\nPerhaps they like that split.\n\nIf I anticipate Beta might do something like A7 B7 C6 or similar, then I could do A8 B7 C5 to beat them on A.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of what would beat Beta's previous allocations.\n\nBeta's Round 1: 8,8,4. To beat that, you need at least 9 on two fields, but total 20. So 9,9,2 for example.\n\nBeta's Round 2:9,9,2. To beat that, 10,4,6 works (as I did), since 10>9, 4<9, 6>2.\n\nBeta's Round 3:7,6,7. To beat that, need two fields higher. So if I did 8,7,5: 8>7 (A), 7>6 (B), 5<7 (C). So win A and B.\n\nBut in Round 3, I did 4,10,6: 4<7, 10>6, 6<7. So only won B.\n\nSo for Round 4, if I assume Beta might do something similar to Round 3, like 7,6,7, then I could do 8,7,5.\n\nBut Beta might change.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do a different allocation.\n\nAnother angle: The game is only 9 rounds, but we're on Round 4. Not sure if there's a pattern yet.\n\nWait, let's see the previous moves:\n\nMy allocations:\n\nR1: 8,8,4\n\nR2:10,4,6\n\nR3:4,10,6\n\nSo I've been rotating where I put the high numbers. R1 balanced, R2 high A, R3 high B. So maybe Round 4 high C? Like 4,4,12? But 12 on C is risky. Or 6,4,10.\n\nWait, if I do A6 B4 C10, then if Beta has something like 7,6,7, then C10 would beat 7, but A6 <7 and B4 <6, so only win C, which isn't enough. Need two.\n\nSo maybe A7 B4 C9. Then against Beta's 7,6,7: A7 tie, B4 <6, C9>7. So tie A, win C, lose B. Still not two wins.\n\nAlternatively, A8 B7 C5. Against 7,6,7: A8>7, B7>6, C5<7. Win A and B.\n\nThat would work against Round 3's Beta allocation.\n\nBut will Beta do something different?\n\nAlternatively, if Beta anticipates I'll go for A and B, they might put more on those.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of Nash equilibrium strategies for Blotto, but with 20 units. However, exact equilibrium might be complex, but some common strategies.\n\nIn 3-field Blotto with total n, often strategies involve splitting into three numbers that sum to n, with some concentration.\n\nGiven that, perhaps a safe move is to do 7-7-6.\n\nBut let's see: 7,7,6.\n\nIf Beta does something like 8,8,4, then I lose A and B (7<8), win C (6>4). Only one win.\n\nIf Beta does 9,9,2: lose A and B, win C. Only one.\n\nIf Beta does 7,6,7: win A (7=7? Tie. Wait, in Blotto, usually tie on a field means no one wins it, so you need strictly more.\n\nSo if I have 7 and Beta has 7, it's a tie, so neither wins the field.\n\nSo for 7,7,6 against Beta's 7,6,7:\n\nA: 7 vs7 tie.\n\nB:7 vs6 I win.\n\nC:6 vs7 Beta wins.\n\nSo only one win (B), which is not enough.\n\nSo 7-7-6 might not be great.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative strategy: 9, 6, 5.\n\nAgainst Beta's R3: 7,6,7.\n\nA:9>7 win.\n\nB:6=6 tie.\n\nC:5<7 lose.\n\nSo only one win. Not good.\n\nHow about 8,6,6.\n\nAgainst R3 Beta 7,6,7:\n\nA:8>7 win.\n\nB:6=6 tie.\n\nC:6<7 lose.\n\nStill only one win.\n\nNeed two wins.\n\nSo to beat R3's Beta allocation (7,6,7), I need two fields where I have more.\n\nSo for example:\n\nA:8, B:7, C:5.\n\nA8>7, B7>6, C5<7. Win A and B.\n\nSum:8+7+5=20. Perfect.\n\nSo if Beta does 7,6,7 again, this would win.\n\nBut Beta probably won't do the exact same.\n\nWhat if Beta does something like 8,7,5?\n\nThen my 8,7,5 would tie all.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta shifts.\n\nAnother example: If Beta does 6,8,6.\n\nThen my 8,7,5 would win A (8>6), lose B (7<8), win C (5<6? No, 5<6 so lose C. Wait, no: 5 vs6, so lose C. So only win A. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative plan: Focus on two fields with 9 and 9, but 9+9=18, so C=2.\n\nBut if Beta does similar to Round 2 where they had C2, then if I do C2, and Beta does higher on C, I lose C.\n\nWait, in Round 2, Beta did C2, I did C6 and won C.\n\nIf I do A9 B9 C2, and Beta does A8 B8 C4 (like Round 1), then I win A and B (9>8), lose C (2<4). So two wins, good.\n\nBut if Beta does A10 B something, might lose.\n\nBut it's a common strategy.\n\nAlternatively, 10, 7, 3.\n\nBut need to think.\n\nWait, let's consider what would have beaten Beta's previous allocations.\n\nFor Beta's Round 1: 8,8,4.\n\nTo win two fields, need ≥9 on two fields. So 9,9,2 would win A and B.\n\nFor Beta's Round 2:9,9,2.\n\nTo win two fields, need >9 on one (e.g., 10 on A), and >2 on C (e.g., 6), and B can be low. Which is what I did.\n\nFor Beta's Round 3:7,6,7.\n\nTo win two, need >7 on A or C, and >6 on B, etc.\n\nSo perhaps a good strategy is to assume Beta might do a similar spread, but vary.\n\nGiven that in Round 3, Beta used two 7s and a 6.\n\nMaybe in Round 4, Beta could do two 8s and a 4, or something.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might go for 6,7,7 as well.\n\nIf I choose 8,7,5.\n\nAs above, which would win against 7,6,7.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does 8,8,4 (like Round 1), then:\n\nA:8 vs8 tie.\n\nB:7 vs8 lose.\n\nC:5 vs4 win.\n\nSo only one win. Not good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative: 7,8,5.\n\nAgainst 8,8,4:\n\nA:7<8, B:8=8 tie, C:5>4. Only one win.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to cover the possibility that Beta might under-allocate on one field.\n\nIf I assume Beta might put ≤5 on one field, then I can put 6 there and win, and distribute the rest to win another.\n\nFor example, if I do A6 B7 C7.\n\nIf Beta has, say, C5, then I win C. Then need to win one more.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nWait, thinking of the previous rounds:\n\nBeta's lowest allocations per round:\n\nRound 1: C4\n\nRound 2: C2\n\nRound 3: B6\n\nSo the lowest field for Beta was C2 in Round 2.\n\nSo maybe Round 4, the low field for Beta could be B or A.\n\nSuppose Beta puts low on B, like 5.\n\nThen if I put 6 on B, and then have 14 left for A and C. Split as 7 and 7.\n\nSo A7 B6 C7.\n\nBut sum is 20.\n\nIf Beta's allocation is, say, A8 B5 C7.\n\nThen:\n\nA:7<8 lose\n\nB:6>5 win\n\nC:7=7 tie\n\nSo only one win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, A8 B6 C6.\n\nIf Beta has A7 B5 C8.\n\nA8>7 win\n\nB6>5 win\n\nC6<8 lose\n\nTwo wins. Good.\n\nBut this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of a strategy where I put 9 on A, 8 on B, 3 on C.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, looking at my previous moves: I've done high on A, then high on B. Maybe Beta expects high on C now.\n\nSo if Beta anticipates that, they might put more on C.\n\nTherefore, to counter, maybe don't go high on C, and instead go high on A and B.\n\nSo like A9 B9 C2.\n\nThis worked in Round 2 when Beta had C2, but they had A9 B9.\n\nWait, in Round 2, Beta did A9 B9 C2, and I did A10 B4 C6. So I won A and C.\n\nIf I do A9 B9 C2 now, and Beta does something else.\n\nSuppose Beta thinks I'll go high on C, so they put more on C.\n\nFor example, Beta does A6 B6 C8.\n\nThen my A9 B9 C2 would win A and B, lose C. Two wins, good.\n\nIf Beta does A8 B8 C4, then my A9 B9 C2 wins A and B.\n\nIf Beta does A7 B7 C6, same thing.\n\nBut if Beta does A10 B something.\n\nWait, but Beta has to allocate 20.\n\nIf Beta does A5 B5 C10.\n\nThen my A9 B9 C2 wins A and B, lose C.\n\nStill two wins.\n\nThis seems like a solid strategy: go high on two fields, low on the third.\n\nThe risk is if Beta also goes high on those two.\n\nBut in Round 1, both did 8-8-4, tie.\n\nIn Round 2, Beta did 9-9-2, and I beat them by having 10 on A.\n\nSo if I do 9-9-2 again, and Beta does something else.\n\nWait, but Beta's Round 2 was 9-9-2.\n\nIf I do 9-9-2 in Round 4, maybe Beta anticipates and puts 10 on A and B.\n\nBut they only have 20 units.\n\nIf Beta does A10 B10 C0.\n\nThen my 9-9-2 would lose both A and B, win C (2>0). Only one win.\n\nBut C0 is possible, though unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, Beta does A10 B9 C1.\n\nThen I lose A and B, win C.\n\nStill bad.\n\nBut is Beta likely to do that?\n\nIn previous rounds, Beta's minimum on a field was 2 (Round 2 C), but they haven't done 0 or 1.\n\nRound 1: min 4\n\nRound 2: min 2\n\nRound 3: min 6\n\nSo maybe Round 4 min could be higher.\n\nAlternatively, if I choose 9-9-2:\n\nPros: Wins against many allocations where Beta doesn't max two fields.\n\nCons: Vulnerable if Beta uses 10-10-0 or similar.\n\nBut given Beta's history, they haven't gone below 2 on a field.\n\nSo maybe 9-9-2 is a good play.\n\nAlternatively, 10-8-2.\n\nSum 20.\n\nIf Beta has A9 B9 C2, then A10 wins, B8 <9, C2=2 tie. So only one win.\n\nNot as good.\n\nWhereas 9-9-2 against Beta's 9-9-2 would tie all.\n\nBut in Round 1, both did 8-8-4 and tied.\n\nSo maybe avoid repeating.\n\nAlternatively, 10-7-3.\n\nIf Beta has 7-6-7:\n\nA10>7, B7>6, C3<7. Win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nIf Beta has 8-8-4:\n\nA10>8, B7<8, C3<4? C3 vs4, lose. So only win A.\n\nNot enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: Since in Round 3, Beta won by having 7 on A and C.\n\nIf I put 8 on A and 8 on C, with 4 on B.\n\nA8 B4 C8.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta's R3 7-6-7:\n\nA8>7, B4<6, C8>7. Win A and C. Perfect.\n\nIf Beta does similar, this would work.\n\nBut what if Beta adjusts.\n\nIf Beta anticipates this, they might put more on A and C.\n\nE.g., Beta does A9 B2 C9.\n\nThen A8<9, C8<9, B4>2. Only win B.\n\nNot good.\n\nBut how likely is Beta to do that.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does A8 B4 C8 (same as me), tie all.\n\nBut better than losing.\n\nAlternatively, this allocation could be good.\n\nLet's check against previous Beta allocations:\n\nR1:8,8,4.\n\nMy A8 B4 C8 vs Beta's 8,8,4.\n\nA:8=8 tie.\n\nB:4<8 lose.\n\nC:8>4 win.\n\nSo only one win. Not enough.\n\nR2: Beta 9,9,2.\n\nMy A8 B4 C8.\n\nA8<9, B4<9, C8>2. Win only C. Lose.\n\nR3: Beta7,6,7.\n\nWin A and C as above.\n\nSo this allocation only works well against R3-type Beta.\n\nBut if Beta varies, it might not be reliable.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative: A7 B6 C7. Same as Beta's R3.\n\nBut that would likely tie if Beta does similar.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, another approach: Use the fact that in R2 and R3, the winning allocations involved having a medium-high on two fields.\n\nIn R2, I won with 10,4,6. So high A, medium C.\n\nIn R3, Beta won with 7,6,7. Medium on all, but higher on A and C.\n\nMaybe a good strategy is to have two fields at 7 or 8.\n\nLet's try A8 B6 C6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst R3 Beta 7,6,7:\n\nA8>7, B6=6 tie, C6<7. Win only A.\n\nNot enough.\n\nA8 B7 C5.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst R3: Win A and B.\n\nAgainst R1 Beta 8,8,4:\n\nA8=8, B7<8, C5>4. Win C only.\n\nAgainst R2 Beta9,9,2:\n\nA8<9, B7<9, C5>2. Win C only.\n\nSo only wins C against R1 and R2, but wins A and B against R3.\n\nNot consistent.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if I do A9 B7 C4.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst R3 Beta7,6,7:\n\nA9>7, B7>6, C4<7. Win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst R1 Beta8,8,4:\n\nA9>8, B7<8, C4=4. Win A only.\n\nAgainst R2 Beta9,9,2:\n\nA9=9, B7<9, C4>2. Win C only.\n\nSo mixed results.\n\nBut if Beta is likely to continue with a strategy similar to R3, this could work.\n\nGiven that R3 was a win for Beta, they might stick to a similar allocation.\n\nSo Beta might do something like A7 B6 C7 again, or A8 B5 C7.\n\nIf I do A9 B7 C4, I win two fields against A7 B6 C7.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta changes to A6 B7 C7.\n\nThen A9>6, B7=7 tie, C4<7. Win only A.\n\nNot enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: Let's think of the most recent round, R3.\n\nBeta won by having more on A and C.\n\nSo for R4, I need to counter that.\n\nIf I put more on A and C than Beta's R3 allocation.\n\nBeta had A7 C7.\n\nSo if I put A8 C8, then B4.\n\nBut sum 20.\n\nA8 B4 C8.\n\nAs considered earlier.\n\nAgainst Beta's R3: Win A and C.\n\nBut if Beta increases A and C to 8 each, then:\n\nBeta A8 B4 C8 (same as me), tie all.\n\nOr Beta A9 B something.\n\nNot sure.\n\nBut if I do A8 B4 C8, and Beta does something like A7 B8 C5.\n\nThen:\n\nA8>7, B4<8, C8>5. Win A and C. Good.\n\nAnother possible Beta allocation: A6 B9 C5.\n\nA8>6, B4<9, C8>5. Win A and C.\n\nSeems decent.\n\nIf Beta does A10 B5 C5.\n\nA8<10, B4<5, C8>5. Win C only.\n\nBad.\n\nBut how likely is Beta to put 10 on A.\n\nIn R2, I did A10, so Beta might think I'll do it again, but I didn't in R3.\n\nNot sure.\n\nOverall, A8 B4 C8 seems like a solid choice to target winning A and C, which Beta focused on in R3.\n\nAlternatively, A7 B4 C9.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst R3 Beta7,6,7:\n\nA7=7 tie, B4<6, C9>7. Win only C.\n\nNot enough.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another idea. In R2, I won by having more on A and C.\n\nIn R3, Beta won by having more on A and C.\n\nSo the key might be controlling A and C.\n\nThus, for R4, it's important to get both A and C.\n\nSo allocate more to A and C.\n\nLet's say A9 C9 B2.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst R3 Beta7,6,7:\n\nA9>7, B2<6, C9>7. Win A and C. Perfect.\n\nAgainst R1 Beta8,8,4:\n\nA9>8, B2<8, C9>4. Win A and C.\n\nAgainst R2 Beta9,9,2:\n\nA9=9 tie, B2<9, C9>2. Win C only.\n\nBut in R2, Beta had C2, so C9 would win.\n\nWait, in R2, Beta had A9 B9 C2.\n\nMy allocation A9 B2 C9:\n\nA:9=9 tie.\n\nB:2<9 lose.\n\nC:9>2 win.\n\nSo only one win. Not enough.\n\nAh, so against R2-type allocation, this fails.\n\nBut Beta might not do that again.\n\nGiven that R3 was a win for Beta with high A and C, they might stick to that strategy.\n\nSo A9 B2 C9 could be good.\n\nBut the risk is if Beta goes high on B.\n\nWait, but in order to beat A9 C9, Beta would need to win B and one other.\n\nBut if Beta puts high on B, say B10, then A and C would be lower.\n\nFor example, Beta A5 B10 C5.\n\nThen my A9 C9 would win A and C.\n\nSo this allocation seems robust against many possibilities.\n\nOnly vulnerable if Beta also does high A and C.\n\nBut if both do high A and C, then it's about who has more.\n\nIf I do A9 C9 B2, and Beta does A8 C8 B4.\n\nThen I win A and C.\n\nIf Beta does A10 C10 but that's 20 already, impossible.\n\nBeta can't do more than 20.\n\nMax on two fields: e.g., A10 C10 is 20, but then B0.\n\nSo if Beta does A10 C10 B0.\n\nMy A9 C9 B2: lose A and C, win B (2>0). Only one win.\n\nBut Beta doing B0 is possible, though in previous rounds Beta's lowest was 2.\n\nSo possible but maybe not likely.\n\nGiven all this, A9 B2 C9 seems like a strong play for Round 4.\n\nLet me check sum: 9+2+9=20. Correct.\n\nAnother check: If Beta copies R3 and does A7 B6 C7.\n\nI win A (9>7), lose B (2<6), win C (9>7). Two wins.\n\nGood.\n\nIf Beta does A8 B8 C4 (R1):\n\nWin A and C.\n\nIf Beta does A6 B7 C7:\n\nWin A and C.\n\nThe main weakness is if Beta does something like A10 B0 C10, but unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, Beta could do A5 B10 C5.\n\nStill win A and C.\n\nSeems solid.\n\nAlternatively, what if Beta anticipates this and does A9 B something C9.\n\nBut they only have 20.\n\nA9 B2 C9 sums to 20. If Beta does same, tie all.\n\nBut better than losing.\n\nAlternatively, Beta does A10 B0 C10, which I lose A and C.\n\nBut again, low probability.\n\nGiven the history, I think A9 B2 C9 is a good choice.\n\nBut wait, in Round 2, Beta had C2. If they do C2 again, then my C9 would win, but they might not.\n\nAlternatively, another allocation: A8 B3 C9.\n\nSum 20.\n\nSimilar idea.\n\nBut A9 B2 C9 seems cleaner.\n\nYes, I think I'll go with A9 B2 C9.\n",

Let me recall the allocations:\n\nRound 1:\n  Alpha: A8 B8 C4\n  Beta:  A8 B8 C4 -> Tie\n\nRound 2:\n  Alpha: A10 B4 C6\n  Beta:  A9 B9 C2 -> Alpha won because:\n      A: 10>9 -> Alpha\n      B: 4<9 -> Beta\n      C: 6>2 -> Alpha\n      So Alpha wins two fields (A and C) -> Alpha wins the round.\n\nRound 3:\n  Alpha: A4 B10 C6\n  Beta:  A7 B6 C7 -> Beta won because:\n      A: 4<7 -> Beta\n      B: 10>6 -> Alpha\n      C: 6<7 -> Beta\n      So Beta wins two fields (A and C) -> Beta wins the round.\n\nNow, for Round 4, we need to allocate 20 troops to A, B, C.\n\nWe must win at least two battlefields to win the round.\n\nWe have seen that Alpha has used:\n  Round1: [8,8,4]\n  Round2: [10,4,6]\n  Round3: [4,10,6]\n\nWe can try to find a pattern in Alpha's play.\n\nObserving Alpha's allocations:\n  Field A: 8, 10, 4 -> average around 7.33\n  Field B: 8, 4, 10 -> average around 7.33\n  Field C: 4, 6, 6 -> average around 5.33\n\nBut note: the total is always 20, so the averages per field might not be independent.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider that Alpha might be trying to spread out or focus on two fields.\n\nIn Round1, Alpha put 8 on A and B and 4 on C (so maybe thinking C is less important?).\nIn Round2, Alpha put 10 on A, 4 on B, 6 on C (so A is very important, B least?).\nIn Round3, Alpha put 4 on A, 10 on B, 6 on C (so B is very important, A least?).\n\nIt seems Alpha is shifting focus. In Round1, Alpha treated A and B equally and C as low. Then in Round2, Alpha focused on A and C (with 10 and 6, total 16) and left B weak (4). In Round3, Alpha focused on B and C (10 and 6) and left A weak (4).\n\nSo a pattern: Alpha is often putting 4 on one field and then 10 and 6 on the other two? But note:\n\nRound1: no 4? Actually, Round1 had 4 on C, but also 8 and 8 on the others. So not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, we might consider that Alpha is trying to win two fields by putting a high number on two and a low on the third.\n\nIn Round2: 10 (high) on A, 6 (medium) on C, 4 (low) on B -> but note 10 is high, 6 is medium, 4 is low.\nIn Round3: 10 (high) on B, 6 (medium) on C, 4 (low) on A.\n\nSo in both Round2 and Round3, Alpha used [4, 10, 6] but assigned to different fields.\n\nRound1 was different: [8,8,4] -> which is two medium and one low.\n\nBut note that in Round1, Beta played the same as Alpha and it tied.\n\nNow, what might Alpha do in Round4?\n\nPossibilities:\n- Alpha might continue the pattern of having one field at 4, one at 10, and one at 6? But which one is which?\n- Or, since Round1 was symmetric, and then Round2 and Round3 were asymmetric, maybe Alpha will try a different asymmetric pattern.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to exploit the fact that in the last two rounds, Alpha put 6 on C both times. Also, in Round1, C was 4 (low). So C has been the low field in Round1 (4) and then medium in Round2 and Round3 (6). \n\nBut note: in Round1, Alpha put 4 on C, which was the lowest. Then in Round2 and 3, Alpha put 6 on C (which was the second highest: 10>6>4 and 10>6>4). So C has been the middle field in the last two rounds.\n\nAnother idea: maybe Alpha is cycling the focus.\n\nRound1: focused on A and B (with 8 each) and neglected C (4).\nRound2: focused on A and C (with 10 and 6) and neglected B (4).\nRound3: focused on B and C (with 10 and 6) and neglected A (4).\n\nSo it seems that in each round, Alpha neglects one field (with 4) and then splits the remaining 16 between the other two as 10 and 6? But wait: 10+6=16, yes.\n\nRound1: neglected C (4), and then A and B got 8 and 8? But 8+8=16, so that fits. However, 8 and 8 is symmetric, while the others are 10 and 6.\n\nSo the pattern might be:\n- In Round1: symmetric on the two focused fields (8 and 8).\n- In Round2: asymmetric on the two focused fields (10 and 6) with A being the highest.\n- In Round3: asymmetric on the two focused fields (10 and 6) with B being the highest.\n\nTherefore, for Round4, if Alpha continues the cycle, they might neglect B? And then focus on A and C, but this time maybe with C as the highest? Or perhaps they alternate the asymmetric split.\n\nBut note: in Round2, when neglecting B, Alpha put 10 on A and 6 on C.\nIn Round3, when neglecting A, Alpha put 10 on B and 6 on C.\n\nSo if in Round4, Alpha neglects C, then they might put 10 on A and 6 on B? Or 10 on B and 6 on A? Or maybe they try symmetric again? But Round1 was symmetric when neglecting C? Actually, Round1 neglected C (with 4) and then did symmetric (8,8) on A and B.\n\nSo it's possible that every time they neglect a field, they split the remaining 16 either symmetrically (8,8) or asymmetrically (10,6) on the other two. But we don't know which split they will choose.\n\nHowever, looking at the sequence:\n  Round1: neglect C -> symmetric (8,8) on A,B.\n  Round2: neglect B -> asymmetric (10,6) on A,C (with A highest).\n  Round3: neglect A -> asymmetric (10,6) on B,C (with B highest).\n\nSo for Round4, if they neglect C again? But they neglected C in Round1. Alternatively, they might neglect a different field? The cycle of neglect: \n  Round1: C\n  Round2: B\n  Round3: A\n  Round4: ? \n\nIt seems they are cycling through neglecting each field in order: C, then B, then A. So next might be C again? But that would be repeating. Alternatively, they might not cycle but choose randomly.\n\nBut note: in Round4, if they continue the cycle, they might neglect C? But they neglected C in Round1 and then in Round4 it would be the second time. Or maybe they are doing a round-robin: one field per round? Then Round4 would be neglecting C again? But that doesn't make sense because they just neglected A in Round3.\n\nAlternatively, it might be that they are trying to avoid the same pattern. \n\nAnother approach: we can try to play to cover the possibilities.\n\nWhat are the likely allocations for Alpha in Round4?\n\nPossibility 1: Alpha neglects C again (putting 4 on C) and then splits 16 on A and B as 10 and 6? Or 8 and 8? Or something else?\n\nBut note: in Round1 they did 8 and 8 on A and B when neglecting C. Maybe they won't do symmetric again? Or maybe they will.\n\nPossibility 2: Alpha neglects a different field, say A (putting 4 on A) and then splits 16 on B and C as 10 and 6 (with B=10, C=6) or (B=6, C=10). But in Round3 they neglected A and put 10 on B and 6 on C. So if they neglect A again, they might do the same? Or switch?\n\nPossibility 3: Alpha neglects B (putting 4 on B) and then splits 16 on A and C as 10 and 6 (like Round2, but in Round2 they did A=10, C=6). But in Round2 they neglected B and did A=10, C=6. So if they neglect B again, they might do the same.\n\nGiven the history, it's hard to say.\n\nBut note: we want to win two fields.\n\nWe can try to play a strategy that covers multiple scenarios.\n\nIdea: \n- We know that in the last two rounds, Alpha put 6 on C. So maybe C is often 6? Then if we put 7 on C, we can win C unless Alpha puts 7 or more.\n- Also, in Round2, Alpha put 10 on A, and in Round3, Alpha put 4 on A. So A is volatile.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to put a moderate amount on all fields? But we have to win two.\n\nAnother idea: since in Round3 we won by putting 7 on A and 7 on C (with 6 on B), and that worked because Alpha had 4 on A and 6 on C (so we beat both A and C). \n\nBut in Round4, if Alpha changes, we need to adjust.\n\nLet me try to anticipate:\n\nScenario 1: Alpha neglects C (puts 4 on C). Then they put 16 on A and B. How? It could be:\n  a) (8,8): then if we put 9 on A and 9 on B and 2 on C, we would win A and B (since 9>8) but lose C (2<4). But wait, 2<4 so we lose C? Actually, 2<4 -> Alpha wins C. But we win A and B -> we win the round. However, we used 9+9+2=20. But note: if they do (8,8) then 9>8 so we win A and B. But what if they do (10,6) for A and B? Then:\n      A: 9 vs 10 -> we lose\n      B: 9 vs 6 -> we win\n      C: 2 vs 4 -> we lose\n      So we only win B -> lose the round.\n\nSo [9,9,2] is risky if Alpha does (10,6) on A and B.\n\nScenario 2: Alpha neglects B (puts 4 on B). Then they put 16 on A and C. How? \n  In Round2, when neglecting B, they did A=10, C=6.\n  So if they do that again: \n      If we have [9,9,2]:\n          A: 9 vs 10 -> lose\n          B: 9 vs 4 -> win\n          C: 2 vs 6 -> lose\n      So we only win B -> lose the round.\n\nScenario 3: Alpha neglects A (puts 4 on A). Then they put 16 on B and C. \n  In Round3, they did B=10, C=6.\n  Then [9,9,2]:\n      A: 9 vs 4 -> win\n      B: 9 vs 10 -> lose\n      C: 2 vs 6 -> lose\n      So we only win A -> lose the round.\n\nTherefore, [9,9,2] only wins if Alpha neglects C and splits symmetrically (8,8). Otherwise, it loses.\n\nBut in Round1, when Alpha neglected C and split symmetrically, we played [8,8,4] and tied. So we don't want to tie again.\n\nWe want to win. So if we play [9,9,2] and Alpha does [8,8,4] we win. But if Alpha does anything else, we might lose.\n\nHowever, note that in Round1, we tied because we played the same. But if we play [9,9,2] and Alpha plays [8,8,4] we win. But what if Alpha plays [9,7,4]? Then:\n  A: 9 vs 9 -> tie? But wait, the rules: win by having more. So tie on A, then:\n  B: 9 vs 7 -> we win\n  C: 2 vs 4 -> we lose\n  So we only win B -> tie the round? Actually, no: we need to win two fields. We only won B, so we don't win the round. But the round is decided by majority: if we have one win, one loss, one tie, then we don't have two wins. So it's a tie? Or does tie count as not winning? The problem says: \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So if we win one and tie one and lose one, then we only have one win -> we don't win the round.\n\nTherefore, [9,9,2] is only safe if Alpha plays exactly [8,8,4] or [8,4,8] or [4,8,8]? But note: if Alpha neglects C, they put 4 on C and then 16 on A and B. So [x, y, 4] with x+y=16.\n\nWe win A if 9 > x, win B if 9 > y.\nWe need both 9>x and 9>y? But x+y=16. If both x<9 and y<9, then x+y<18, which is true (16<18) but we need x<=8 and y<=8? Then x+y<=16, which is okay. But if x=8, y=8 -> we win both. If x=9, y=7 -> then we tie A and win B? But tie A: we don't win A, so we only win B -> not enough.\n\nSo we need both x<9 and y<9, i.e., x<=8 and y<=8. But x+y=16, so the only possibility is x=8, y=8.\n\nTherefore, [9,9,2] only wins if Alpha plays [8,8,4] (or permuted? but note: if Alpha neglects C, they put 4 on C, so it must be [x,y,4] with x+y=16). So [8,8,4] is the only one that works.\n\nBut Alpha might not play [8,8,4] again. They played that in Round1 and then changed.\n\nSo we need a more robust strategy.\n\nAlternative idea: we can try to put 7 on two fields and 6 on the third? But 7+7+6=20.\n\nWhy 7? Because:\n- In Round3, we won by having 7 on A and 7 on C (with 6 on B) because Alpha had 4 on A and 6 on C. So 7>4 and 7>6 -> we won A and C.\n\nWhat if we do [7,7,6]?\n\nLet's see against possible Alpha plays:\n\nCase 1: Alpha plays [8,8,4] (like Round1)\n  A: 7 vs 8 -> lose\n  B: 7 vs 8 -> lose\n  C: 6 vs 4 -> win\n  We only win C -> lose.\n\nCase 2: Alpha plays [10,4,6] (like Round2)\n  A: 7 vs 10 -> lose\n  B: 7 vs 4 -> win\n  C: 6 vs 6 -> tie\n  So we win only B -> not enough (need two wins). So tie the round? Actually, we don't have two wins -> we don't win the round.\n\nCase 3: Alpha plays [4,10,6] (like Round3)\n  A: 7 vs 4 -> win\n  B: 7 vs 10 -> lose\n  C: 6 vs 6 -> tie\n  We win only A -> not enough.\n\nSo [7,7,6] doesn't win in any of the historical plays.\n\nBut what if Alpha plays something else?\n\nSuppose Alpha neglects C and plays [9,7,4]:\n  A: 7 vs 9 -> lose\n  B: 7 vs 7 -> tie\n  C: 6 vs 4 -> win\n  -> only one win.\n\nOr if Alpha plays [10,6,4]:\n  A: 7 vs 10 -> lose\n  B: 7 vs 6 -> win\n  C: 6 vs 4 -> win\n  -> we win B and C -> we win the round.\n\nSo [7,7,6] wins if Alpha plays [10,6,4] (which is similar to Round2 but with B and C swapped? Round2 was [10,4,6] so not exactly).\n\nBut note: in Round2, Alpha played [10,4,6] which would lead to:\n  A: 7<10 -> lose\n  B: 7>4 -> win\n  C: 6==6 -> tie\n  -> only one win.\n\nBut if Alpha plays [10,6,4] (which is neglecting C? no, 4 on C) then:\n  A: 10 -> we have 7 -> lose\n  B: 6 -> we have 7 -> win\n  C: 4 -> we have 6 -> win\n  -> we win B and C -> win.\n\nBut is [10,6,4] a likely play? It's similar to Round2 but with B and C swapped. Round2 was [10,4,6] (so B=4, C=6). Now if they do [10,6,4], that would be B=6, C=4.\n\nSo it's a possibility.\n\nBut we don't know.\n\nAnother idea: we can try to put 8 on two fields and 4 on the third? But 8+8+4=20.\n\nExample: [8,8,4]\n\nAgainst Round1 play: [8,8,4] -> tie.\n\nAgainst Round2: [10,4,6]:\n  A: 8<10 -> lose\n  B: 8>4 -> win\n  C: 4<6 -> lose\n  -> only win B -> lose.\n\nAgainst Round3: [4,10,6]:\n  A: 8>4 -> win\n  B: 8<10 -> lose\n  C: 4<6 -> lose\n  -> only win A -> lose.\n\nSo not good.\n\nWhat if we do [6,7,7]? Same as [7,7,6] but permuted.\n\nWe need to choose which field to put the 6 on.\n\nLooking at history, C has been:\n  Round1: Alpha 4, we 4 -> tie\n  Round2: Alpha 6, we 2 -> Alpha wins C (6>2)\n  Round3: Alpha 6, we 7 -> we win C (7>6)\n\nSo C has been contested.\n\nAlso, in Round2 and Round3, Alpha put 6 on C. So maybe in Round4, Alpha will put more than 6 on C? Or less?\n\nBut note: in Round1, they put 4 on C. So it varies.\n\nAnother strategy: overcommit to two fields that we think Alpha will neglect.\n\nFrom the pattern, Alpha neglected:\n  Round1: C (put 4 on C)\n  Round2: B (put 4 on B)\n  Round3: A (put 4 on A)\n\nSo it seems Alpha is neglecting a different field each round. Therefore, in Round4, they might neglect C again? Or start over? But the pattern was C, B, A. The next might be C again? Or perhaps they will neglect a field that hasn't been neglected in the last two? But all have been neglected once.\n\nAlternatively, they might neglect the same field twice? Unlikely.\n\nPerhaps the neglect pattern is random? But the sequence C, B, A might be a cycle, so next is C? But then it would be C again.\n\nBut Round1 was C, then Round4 would be C again. That's possible.\n\nSo let's assume that in Round4, Alpha neglects C (puts 4 on C). Then they put 16 on A and B. How?\n\nIn Round1, when neglecting C, they put 8 and 8 on A and B.\n\nBut they might not do symmetric again. They did asymmetric in Round2 and Round3.\n\nSo maybe they will do asymmetric: 10 on A and 6 on B, or 10 on B and 6 on A.\n\nTherefore, if we assume Alpha neglects C (4 on C), then:\n\nOption: \n  If Alpha does (10,6) on A,B: \n      We want to beat both? But 10 and 6: to beat 10 we need at least 11, to beat 6 we need at least 7. But 11+7=18, then we have 2 left for C -> but we are assuming C is neglected by Alpha so we don't need much on C? Actually, if we put 11 on A, 7 on B, 2 on C, then:\n          A: 11>10 -> win\n          B: 7>6 -> win\n          C: 2<4? -> lose (but we don't care because we won two)\n      So we win.\n\n  If Alpha does (8,8) on A,B:\n      11>8, 7>8? -> 7<8 so we lose B. Then:\n          A: win, B: lose, C: lose -> only one win -> lose.\n\n  If Alpha does (6,10) on A,B (i.e., A=6, B=10):\n      A: 11>6 -> win\n      B: 7<10 -> lose\n      C: 2<4 -> lose\n      -> only one win.\n\nSo [11,7,2] wins only if Alpha does (10,6) on A,B (i.e., A=10, B=6). But if they do (6,10) we lose.\n\nAlternatively, we could do [7,11,2] to cover (6,10) on A,B.\n\nBut we don't know which one they will do.\n\nTo cover both possibilities, we might need to put at least 11 on both A and B? But 11+11=22>20 -> impossible.\n\nSo we have to choose one.\n\nWhat if we put 9 on A and 9 on B and 2 on C? As before, but we saw it only works for (8,8).\n\nAnother idea: put 10 on A and 10 on B and 0 on C? But 0 might be too low: if Alpha puts 4 on C, then 0<4 -> lose C. And if they put 10 on A, then 10 vs 10 -> tie? So:\n  A: tie, B: if they put less than 10 on B we win B, but if they put 10 on B then tie. \n  So if Alpha plays [10,10,0]? But they have to allocate 20. If they neglect C, they put 4 on C, so they can't put 0. They put 4 on C, so A+B=16. So they can't put 10 on both A and B.\n\nSo if Alpha neglects C (4 on C), then A+B=16. The maximum they can put on one field is 16 (and 0 on the other). But they are likely to split.\n\nBut if we put [10,10,0]:\n  Against [16,0,4]:\n      A: 10<16 -> lose\n      B: 10>0 -> win\n      C: 0<4 -> lose\n      -> only win B -> lose.\n\n  Against [10,6,4]:\n      A: 10==10 -> tie\n      B: 10>6 -> win\n      C: 0<4 -> lose\n      -> only win B -> lose.\n\n  Against [8,8,4]:\n      A: 10>8 -> win\n      B: 10>8 -> win\n      C: 0<4 -> lose\n      -> win A and B -> win.\n\nSo [10,10,0] wins if Alpha plays [8,8,4] but loses otherwise.\n\nBut we think Alpha might not play [8,8,4] again.\n\nAnother idea: since in the last two rounds, Alpha put 6 on C, maybe they will put more than 6 on C in Round4? Or less?\n\nBut we don't know.\n\nPerhaps we can try to win two fields by putting more than what Alpha typically puts on two fields.\n\nFrom the data:\n  A: [8,10,4] -> min=4, max=10, common values: 4,8,10\n  B: [8,4,10] -> min=4, max=10, common values: 4,8,10\n  C: [4,6,6] -> min=4, max=6, common values: 4,6\n\nSo for C, it's either 4 or 6. For A and B, it's 4,8,10.\n\nTo win a field, we need to put one more than what Alpha puts.\n\nWe want to win two fields.\n\nSuppose we try to win A and B.\n\nWe need to put at least 5 on A (to beat the min 4) and at least 5 on B, but that's not enough because Alpha might put 8 or 10.\n\nTo beat the max (10) on A, we need 11. Similarly for B.\n\nBut 11+11=22>20, so we can't cover both A and B against the max.\n\nSo we have to choose which field we think Alpha will put low.\n\nFrom the pattern of neglect: \n  Round1: C neglected (4) -> A and B got 8 each.\n  Round2: B neglected (4) -> A got 10, C got 6.\n  Round3: A neglected (4) -> B got 10, C got 6.\n\nSo the neglected field gets 4, and then the other two get 10 and 6.\n\nTherefore, in Round4, if we assume the neglect pattern continues, they might neglect C again? But they neglected C in Round1, then B in Round2, then A in Round3. So the next neglect might be C again? Or maybe it's a cycle of three: C, B, A, and then repeat? So Round4: C.\n\nSo let's assume they neglect C -> put 4 on C.\n\nThen they will put 16 on A and B, split as 10 and 6.\n\nBut which one gets 10 and which one gets 6? In Round1 when neglecting C, they put 8 and 8. But in Round2 and Round3, when neglecting, they did 10 and 6. So maybe they will do 10 and 6 this time too.\n\nBut which field gets 10? In Round2 (neglecting B), they gave 10 to A. In Round3 (neglecting A), they gave 10 to B. So it seems they give 10 to the field that is \"first\" in some order? Or randomly.\n\nPerhaps they alternate: \n  When neglecting B (Round2), they put 10 on A (the first field).\n  When neglecting A (Round3), they put 10 on B (the second field).\n  When neglecting C (Round4), they might put 10 on A or B? But which one?\n\nAlternatively, they might put 10 on the field that was neglected in the previous round? \n  Previous round (Round3) neglected A, so this round (neglecting C) they might put 10 on A? \n  Or on B? \n\nThis is getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, a safe play might be to put 7 on A, 7 on B, and 6 on C.\n\nWhy?\n- If Alpha neglects C (4 on C), then:\n      C: 6>4 -> we win C.\n      Now, to win the round, we need to win one more field.\n      A: 7 vs whatever on A. If Alpha put 10 on A, then 7<10 -> lose A.\n          B: 7 vs 6 -> win B (because if A=10 then B=6, since 10+6=16)\n          So we win B and C -> win.\n      If Alpha put 6 on A and 10 on B, then:\n          A: 7>6 -> win A\n          B: 7<10 -> lose B\n          C: win -> so we win A and C -> win.\n      If Alpha put 8 and 8, then:\n          A: 7<8 -> lose\n          B: 7<8 -> lose\n          C: win -> only one win -> lose.\n\nBut if they put 8 and 8, we lose. But we think they are more likely to do 10 and 6 now (since they did 8 and 8 in Round1).\n\nSo [7,7,6] wins against the asymmetric split on A and B (whether A is 10 or B is 10) but loses against the symmetric split.\n\nWhat if Alpha does not neglect C? For example, if they neglect A (put 4 on A) and put 10 on B and 6 on C.\n\nThen:\n  A: 7>4 -> win\n  B: 7 vs 10 -> lose\n  C: 6 vs 6 -> tie\n  -> only win A -> lose.\n\nSimilarly, if they neglect B (put 4 on B) and put 10 on A and 6 on C:\n  A: 7 vs 10 -> lose\n  B: 7>4 -> win\n  C: 6 vs 6 -> tie\n  -> only win B -> lose.\n\nSo [7,7,6] only wins if Alpha neglects C and splits asymmetrically (10 and 6) on A and B.\n\nBut if Alpha neglects C and splits symmetrically (8,8), we lose.\n\nAnd if Alpha neglects a different field, we lose.\n\nHowever, if we believe the pattern of neglect is cycling and Round4 is C (as per Round1), and that they will do asymmetric split (as in Round2 and Round3), then [7,7,6] is good.\n\nMoreover, in Round1 when they did symmetric, we tied with [8,8,4] but now we are playing [7,7,6] which would lose against [8,8,4] but we think they won't do symmetric again.\n\nAlternatively, we can try [6,7,7] but assign the 6 to a different field.\n\nBut which field to put the 6 on? \n\nIf we put [7,6,7]:\n  If Alpha neglects C (4 on C):\n      C: 7>4 -> win\n      A: 7 vs ? \n      B: 6 vs ? \n      If Alpha does A=10, B=6: \n          A: 7<10 -> lose\n          B: 6==6 -> tie\n          C: win -> only one win -> lose.\n      If Alpha does A=6, B=10:\n          A: 7>6 -> win\n          B: 6<10 -> lose\n          C: win -> win A and C -> win.\n\n  So it wins only if Alpha gives 10 to B and 6 to A.\n\n  But we don't know which way they will split.\n\n  Similarly, [6,7,7] wins if Alpha gives 10 to A and 6 to B.\n\nSo to be safe, we want a play that wins regardless of which field gets the 10.\n\n[7,7,6] as above wins in both cases when neglecting C and split as 10 and 6.\n\nBut if we do [7,7,6] and they neglect C, we win regardless of whether A=10,B=6 or A=6,B=10.\n\nWhereas [6,7,7] only wins for one of the splits.\n\nSo [7,7,6] is better for the case of neglecting C.\n\nBut what if they neglect a different field? Then [7,7,6] loses, as shown.\n\nHowever, if we believe the neglect pattern, Round4 is C.\n\nMoreover, even if they neglect a different field, we might still have a chance if they don't follow the split pattern.\n\nBut let's see the probability.\n\nGiven that in the last two rounds they did asymmetric split, and only Round1 was symmetric, it's more likely they will do asymmetric.\n\nAlso, the neglect pattern: Round1: C, Round2: B, Round3: A, so Round4: C.\n\nTherefore, I think [7,7,6] is a good bet.\n\nBut note: in Round3, we played [7,6,7] and won because Alpha neglected A (4 on A) and we had 7 on A and 7 on C (with 6 on B). \n  Specifically: \n      A: 7>4 -> win\n      B: 6<10 -> lose\n      C: 7>6 -> win.\n\nSo we won A and C.\n\nNow, if in Round4, if Alpha neglects C (4 on C), then we want to win C and one of A or B.\n\nWith [7,7,6]:\n  C: 6>4 -> win\n  A: 7 vs X\n  B: 7 vs Y\n\nAnd since X+Y=16, and they are split as 10 and 6 (asymmetric) or 8 and 8 (symmetric).\n\nIf asymmetric:\n  If X=10, Y=6: \n      A: 7<10 -> lose\n      B: 7>6 -> win\n      -> win B and C -> win.\n  If X=6, Y=10:\n      A: 7>6 -> win\n      B: 7<10 -> lose\n      -> win A and C -> win.\n\nIf symmetric (8,8):\n  A: 7<8 -> lose\n  B: 7<8 -> lose\n  -> only win C -> lose.\n\nBut we hope they do asymmetric.\n\nAlternatively, we can do [8,7,5] or something, but let's see.\n\nAnother idea: do [8,6,6]?\n\nIf Alpha neglects C (4 on C):\n  C: 6>4 -> win\n  A: 8 vs X\n  B: 6 vs Y\n\nIf X=10, Y=6:\n  A: 8<10 -> lose\n  B: 6==6 -> tie\n  -> only win C -> lose.\n\nIf X=6, Y=10:\n  A: 8>6 -> win\n  B: 6<10 -> lose\n  -> win A and C -> win.\n\nBut it only wins for one split.\n\nWhereas [7,7,6] wins for both splits.\n\nSo [7,7,6] is better.\n\nWhat if we do [7,8,5]? \n  If X=10,Y=6:\n      A:7<10, B:8>6 -> win B and C -> win.\n  If X=6,Y=10:\n      A:7>6, B:8<10 -> win A and C -> win.\n  Same as [7,7,6]? But [7,8,5] has 5 on C, which might be risky if Alpha doesn't neglect C.\n\nBut if Alpha neglects C (4 on C), then 5>4 -> still win C.\n\nBut if Alpha does not neglect C, say they neglect A (4 on A), and put 10 on B and 6 on C:\n  A:7>4 -> win\n  B:8 vs 10 -> lose\n  C:5 vs 6 -> lose\n  -> only win A -> lose.\n\nSame as [7,7,6] in that scenario.\n\nBut [7,7,6] uses 6 on C, which is better for winning C if Alpha puts 6 on C? \n  If Alpha puts 6 on C, then 6 vs 6 -> tie, so we don't win C.\n  But in the scenario where they neglect C, they put 4 on C, so 6>4 wins.\n\nHowever, if they do not neglect C, and put 6 on C (as in Round2 and Round3), then [7,7,6] on C: 6 vs 6 -> tie.\n\nWhereas [7,8,5] on C: 5<6 -> lose.\n\nSo [7,7,6] is better because in non-neglect of C, if they put 6 on C, we tie (which is better than losing).\n\nBut in the non-neglect scenario, we don't win the round anyway with either, so it doesn't matter.\n\nBut if by chance they put 5 on C, then [7,7,6] would win C (6>5) while [7,8,5] would tie (5==5) or lose if they put more.\n\nHowever, historically they put either 4 or 6 on C, so 5 might not be relevant.\n\nGiven that, [7,7,6] seems robust for the neglect-C scenario.\n\nAnd for other scenarios, it doesn't win, but we hope the pattern holds.\n\nAnother option: [6,7,7] but we have to choose which field gets 6.\n\nIf we put 6 on A, then [6,7,7]:\n  If Alpha neglects C (4 on C):\n      C:7>4 -> win\n      A:6 vs X\n      B:7 vs Y\n      If X=10,Y=6: \n          A:6<10, B:7>6 -> win B and C -> win.\n      If X=6,Y=10:\n          A:6==6 -> tie, B:7<10 -> lose -> only win C -> lose.\n\n  So it only wins for one split.\n\nWhereas [7,7,6] wins for both splits.\n\nTherefore, we should put the 6 on C? But wait, in [7,7,6], we have 6 on C.\n\nBut if Alpha does not neglect C, and puts 6 on C (as in Round2 and Round3), then we tie on C.\n\nBut if we put 7 on C, like in [7,6,7] (with 6 on B), then:\n  If Alpha neglects C (4 on C):\n      C:7>4 -> win\n      A:7 vs X\n      B:6 vs Y\n      If X=10,Y=6: \n          A:7<10, B:6==6 -> tie -> only win C -> lose.\n      If X=6,Y=10:\n          A:7>6, B:6<10 -> win A and C -> win.\n\n  So only wins for one split.\n\nHence, [7,7,6] is the only one that wins for both splits when neglecting C.\n\nTherefore, I choose [7,7,6].\n\nBut let me confirm the allocation: 7+7+6=20.\n\nAnd the output format: [A7 B7 C6]\n\nHowever, note: in the previous round (Round3) we played [A7 B6 C7]. Now we are playing [A7 B7 C6]. \n\nThis might be detectable, but we have to try.\n\nAnother thought: what if Alpha in Round4 neglects C and does symmetric [8,8,4]? Then we lose. But we think they are unlikely to do symmetric again.\n\nGiven the history, it's a calculated risk.\n\nWe could do [8,7,5] but as above, it doesn't cover both splits as well.\n\nOr [7,8,5]: same issue.\n\n[8,6,6]: as above, only covers one split.\n\nSo [7,7,6] seems best.\n\nLet's try to see if there's a play that wins even if they neglect a different field.\n\nFor example, suppose we put 5 on A, 5 on B, and 10 on C.\n\nThen:\n  If Alpha neglects C (4 on C): \n      C:10>4 -> win\n      A:5 vs X, B:5 vs Y.\n      If X=10,Y=6: 5<10 and 5<6 -> lose both A and B -> only win C -> lose.\n      Similarly for other splits.\n\n  If Alpha neglects A (4 on A):\n      A:5>4 -> win\n      B:5 vs Y, C:10 vs Z.\n      Typically, if neglecting A, they put 10 on B and 6 on C (as Round3).\n          B:5<10 -> lose\n          C:10>6 -> win\n          -> win A and C -> win.\n\n  If Alpha neglects B (4 on B):\n      B:5>4 -> win\n      A:5 vs X, C:10 vs Z.\n      Typically, X=10, Z=6 (Round2):\n          A:5<10 -> lose\n          C:10>6 -> win\n          -> win B and C -> win.\n\nSo [5,5,10] wins if Alpha neglects A or B, but loses if Alpha neglects C.\n\nNow, what is the probability that Alpha neglects C in Round4? \n  They neglected C in Round1, then B in Round2, then A in Round3. \n  So if they are cycling, Round4 should be C.\n\nBut if they are cycling through neglecting each field, then after A (Round3), the next should be C? But the cycle was C, B, A, so the next after A is C? \n\nActually, the sequence: \n  Round1: C\n  Round2: B\n  Round3: A\n  Round4: ? \n\nIf it's a fixed cycle, it might be C, B, A, C, B, A, ... so Round4 would be C.\n\nTherefore, [5,5,10] would lose if they neglect C.\n\nWhereas [7,7,6] would win if they neglect C and do asymmetric split.\n\nGiven that they did asymmetric in the last two rounds, and symmetric only once, and the neglect pattern points to C, I think [7,7,6] is better.\n\nMoreover, in Round1 when they neglected C, they did symmetric, but then they changed to asymmetric. So likely they will do asymmetric this time.\n\nTherefore, I'll go with [A7 B7 C6].\n\nBut let's write it as [A7 B7 C6] -> 7+7+6=20.\n\nOutput must be: [A7 B7 C6]\n\nNote: the format is with spaces: '[A7 B7 C6]'\n\nBut in the example, they had '[A4 B2 C2]' so yes.\n\nSo final decision.\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how to allocate 20 troops across A, B, and C for Round 5. So far, the rounds have gone like this:\n\nRound 1: Both did A8 B8 C4. Tie.\nRound 2: I did A10 B4 C6, Beta did A9 B9 C2. I won because I took A and C, Beta took B.\nRound 3: I did A4 B10 C6, Beta did A7 B6 C7. Beta won A and C, I took B.\nRound 4: I did A9 B2 C9, Beta did A7 B7 C6. I won A and C, Beta took B.\n\nNow it's Round 5. The score is Alpha 2, Beta 1. I need to win two battlefields again.\n\nLooking at Beta's past allocations:\n- Round 1: 8,8,4\n- Round 2: 9,9,2\n- Round 3: 7,6,7\n- Round 4: 7,7,6\n\nHmm, Beta seems to have a pattern. In Round 1, they spread evenly but with C lower. Round 2, they focused on A and B with high numbers, low on C. Round 3, they went for A and C with 7 each, B lower. Round 4, similar to Round 3 but adjusted C to 6.\n\nSo maybe Beta is trying to spread but sometimes focuses on two fields. Let me think about possible strategies.\n\nIn Blotto games, common strategies include splitting into two high and one low, or equal distribution. Since the total is 20, splitting into 7-7-6 (sum 20) is common. Beta used that in Rounds 3 and 4.\n\nWait, in Round 2, Beta did 9,9,2. So maybe they switch between focusing on two fields with high numbers and leaving one low.\n\nI need to anticipate Beta's move. If Beta repeats the 7-7-6 pattern, then to win two fields, I need to have more than 7 in two fields. But 7+7=14, so if I put 8 in two fields, that's 16, leaving 4 for the third. But 8+8+4=20. Wait, but in Round 1, both did 8,8,4 and tied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta will vary. Let's see past responses.\n\nIn Round 2, when I did 10,4,6, Beta did 9,9,2. So Beta took B and maybe A? Wait, no. Wait in Round 2, I had A10 vs Beta A9, so I won A. B: me 4 vs Beta 9, Beta won B. C: me 6 vs Beta 2, I won C. So I won A and C.\n\nIn Round 3, I did 4,10,6. Beta did 7,6,7. So Beta won A (7>4) and C (7>6), I won B (10>6).\n\nRound 4: I did 9,2,9. Beta did 7,7,6. So I won A (9>7) and C (9>6), Beta won B (7>2).\n\nSo Beta's allocations: Round 2: 9,9,2; Round 3:7,6,7; Round 4:7,7,6.\n\nMaybe Beta is trying to cover two fields with around 7-9 and leave one low. Let's see if there's a cycle.\n\nIn Round 5, what might Beta do? Maybe they'll switch which field is low. In Round 2, C was low (2). Round 3, B was middle (6), A and C 7. Round 4, C was 6, so maybe next they make B low?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta is reacting to my previous moves.\n\nIn Round 1, we both did the same, tie.\n\nRound 2: I went high on A and C (10 and 6), low on B (4). Beta went high on A and B (9 each), very low on C (2). So Beta probably expected me to spread, but I focused on A and C.\n\nRound 3: I went high on B (10), so Beta might have responded by lowering B to 6, and putting 7 on A and C. Which worked because I had A4 and C6, so Beta's 7s won.\n\nRound 4: I went A9 C9, low B2. Beta did A7 B7 C6. So they covered A and B with 7, but I had higher on A and C.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is trying to match my previous high fields but adjust.\n\nWait, in Round 3, I had high B (10), so Beta lowered B to 6, and put 7 on A and C. Then in Round 4, I went high on A and C again (9 each), so Beta put 7 on A and B, but C was 6. Wait no, Round 4 Beta was A7 B7 C6.\n\nHmm. Maybe Beta is using a strategy of putting 7 on two fields and the rest on the third. Wait 7+7+6=20.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is using 7-7-6 in Rounds 3 and 4. Round 2 was 9-9-2, which sums to 20 as well.\n\nSo possible that Beta alternates between different distributions.\n\nFor Round 5, if I assume Beta might go back to a 7-7-6 or similar, I need to beat two of them.\n\nIf Beta does 7-7-6 on A-B-C, then to win two fields, I need >7 on two fields. So 8 on two fields would be 16, leaving 4 for the third. But 8+8+4=20. However, in Round 1, this led to a tie when Beta also did 8-8-4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta will do something else. Let's think of possible patterns.\n\nAnother approach: since winning two fields is the goal, maybe focus on two fields with 9 each (18 total), leaving 2 for the third. But in Round 4, I did 9,2,9 and won because Beta had 7,7,6. So A9 >7, C9>6, so won two.\n\nBut if Beta anticipates that, they might put more on A and C. Wait in Round 4, Beta's C was 6, which was less than my 9.\n\nWait, let's list all Beta's allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\n\nRound 2: A9 B9 C2\n\nRound 3: A7 B6 C7\n\nRound 4: A7 B7 C6\n\nSo in Round 1, C was lowest (4). Round 2, C lowest (2). Round 3, B lowest (6). Round 4, C lowest (6). Hmm, not a clear pattern. Maybe Beta is rotating which field is lowest.\n\nRound 1: C low (4)\n\nRound 2: C low (2)\n\nRound 3: B low (6)\n\nRound 4: C low (6)\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe Beta is trying to counter my previous move.\n\nIn Round 2, I did A10 B4 C6. Beta responded with A9 B9 C2. So they put high on B and A, low on C.\n\nIn Round 3, I did A4 B10 C6. Beta did A7 B6 C7. So they lowered B to 6 (since I went high on B), and increased A and C.\n\nIn Round 4, I did A9 B2 C9. Beta did A7 B7 C6. So they increased B to 7 (because I went low on B), and kept A and C lower than my 9s.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is reacting by strengthening the field where I was weak and weakening where I was strong.\n\nLet's check:\n\nRound 2: My allocation was A10 (high), B4 (low), C6 (medium). Beta's response: A9 (close to my A), B9 (high, since I was low on B), C2 (very low). So they took B and possibly A, but I had A10 which beat A9.\n\nRound 3: My allocation was A4 (low), B10 (high), C6 (medium). Beta's response: A7 (higher than my A4), B6 (lower than my B10), C7 (higher than my C6). So they took A and C, which worked.\n\nRound 4: My allocation was A9 (high), B2 (very low), C9 (high). Beta's response: A7 (lower than my A9), B7 (high since I was low on B), C6 (lower than my C9). So they took B, and I took A and C.\n\nSo the pattern seems that Beta is:\n\n- When I have a very low on a field, they put a medium/high there to take it.\n\n- When I have high on a field, they put just enough to possibly counter if I repeat, but maybe not always.\n\nSo for Round 5, what was my last move? Round 4: A9 B2 C9.\n\nSo I was very low on B (2). Beta put 7 on B, which took it.\n\nSo for Round 5, if I follow the pattern, I might want to not be low on B again. Maybe I should balance more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta expects me to go high on B now, so they might lower B.\n\nWait, to win, I need two fields. Let's think of possible allocations.\n\nIf I spread as 7-7-6, similar to Beta's recent moves, but that might lead to ties.\n\nAlternatively, do 8-7-5. But need sum 20.\n\nWait, another idea: in Blotto, a common strategy is to use a distribution that covers two fields with just enough to beat common allocations.\n\nGiven Beta's recent moves (Rounds 3 and 4: 7-6-7 and 7-7-6), perhaps they are settling into 7-7-6 variations.\n\nSo if I assume Beta will do 7-7-6 on A-B-C, then to win two fields, I need more than 7 on two fields. So 8 on two fields (8+8=16), leaving 4 on the third. So 8-8-4.\n\nBut in Round 1, when both did 8-8-4, it was a tie. So if Beta does the same, tie. But maybe Beta varies.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does 7-7-6, then 8-7-5 would win A (8>7), tie B (7=7), lose C (5<6). So only one win. Not good.\n\nWait, need to win two. So need > in two.\n\nIf Beta has 7,7,6.\n\nIf I do 8,8,4: beat A and B (8>7 each), lose C (4<6). So two wins. That works.\n\nBut if Beta also does 8,8,4, then tie all, which happened in Round 1.\n\nBut Beta's recent moves are 7s and 6s, so maybe not 8s.\n\nAlternatively, do 9,7,4. Then vs 7,7,6: A9>7, B7=7, C4<6. So only one win.\n\nNot good.\n\nHow about 9,8,3. Then A9>7, B8>7, C3<6. Two wins. That works.\n\nSum is 20.\n\nSimilarly, 10,7,3: 10+7+3=20. A10>7, B7=7, C3<6. Only one win.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, 9,8,3 vs Beta's 7,7,6: A:9>7, B:8>7, so two wins. Good.\n\nBut what if Beta changes their allocation?\n\nSuppose in Round 5, Beta anticipates I'll go high on A and B, so they put more on C.\n\nAlternatively, based on my Round 4 move (A9 B2 C9), Beta might think I'll go high on A and C again, so they might put more on A and C.\n\nIn Round 4, I did A9 C9, Beta did A7 C6. So they lost both A and C.\n\nSo for Round 5, Beta might increase A and C.\n\nSuppose Beta decides to put 8 on A and 8 on C, leaving 4 on B. Then if I do 9,8,3, I'd have A9>8, B8>4, C3<8. So win A and B. But wait, Beta's allocation would be A8 B4 C8.\n\nWait, but Beta's total must be 20. So 8+4+8=20.\n\nIf I do 9,8,3: sum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta's 8,4,8:\n\nA:9>8, B:8>4, C:3<8. So I win A and B. Good.\n\nBut if Beta instead does 9,2,9 (mirroring my Round 4), then:\n\nMy 9,8,3 vs Beta 9,2,9: A tie, B:8>2, C:3<9. So only one win (B). Not enough.\n\nHmm, risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I do 7,7,6 like Beta's recent moves.\n\nAgainst Beta's 7,7,6: all ties. Not good.\n\nBut if Beta varies, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, think of what worked before.\n\nIn Round 2: I did 10,4,6 and won because Beta did 9,9,2. So I won A and C.\n\nRound 4: I did 9,2,9 and won A and C against Beta's 7,7,6.\n\nSo focusing on A and C with high numbers worked when Beta didn't defend them enough.\n\nIn Round 3, when I focused on B (10), Beta had lowered B to 6, but increased A and C to 7, so they won A and C.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to choose two fields that Beta is likely to under-allocate.\n\nGiven Beta's last move was Round 4: A7 B7 C6.\n\nSo C was lowest at 6. Maybe Beta will increase C next time, or maybe keep it low.\n\nIf I assume Beta might keep C lower, then putting high on A and C could work.\n\nWait in Round 4, Beta's C was 6, and I had C9 which won.\n\nSo for Round 5, if Beta raises C to 7 or 8, then I need to have more than that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Beta will rotate which field is lowest.\n\nIn Round 4, C was lowest (6). Maybe Round 5, B is lowest.\n\nSuppose Beta does A7 B6 C7.\n\nThen if I do A8 B8 C4: beat A and B, lose C. Two wins.\n\nOr if I do A9 B9 C2: beat A and B if Beta has 7 and 6.\n\nBut need to sum 20.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider possible Beta allocations based on history.\n\nBeta's allocations:\n\nR1: 8,8,4\n\nR2:9,9,2\n\nR3:7,6,7\n\nR4:7,7,6\n\nLooking at this, the allocations seem to cycle the lowest number.\n\nR1: C=4\n\nR2: C=2\n\nR3: B=6\n\nR4: C=6\n\nMaybe the lowest is moving between C and B.\n\nIf following that, R5 lowest might be B again? Or A?\n\nNot clear.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of all Beta's allocations per field:\n\nA:8+9+7+7=31\n\nB:8+9+6+7=30\n\nC:4+2+7+6=19\n\nSo Beta has allocated less to C overall. Maybe C is being under-allocated by Beta.\n\nIn R1: C=4\n\nR2: C=2\n\nR3: C=7\n\nR4: C=6\n\nSo after two low Cs, they increased. Maybe in R5, C could be medium.\n\nBut hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: in order to win two fields, a safe strategy is to allocate 7,7,6. Because if the opponent has any field below 7, you take it. But if they have similar, ties.\n\nBut since we need to beat two, maybe 8,7,5.\n\nWait, if I do 8,7,5.\n\nAgainst Beta's possible 7,7,6: A8>7, B7=7, C5<6. So only one win. Not good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, the minimal to guarantee beating a 7 is 8.\n\nSo to beat two 7s, need two 8s. 8+8+4=20.\n\nSo [A8 B8 C4].\n\nBut if Beta does the same, tie. But given Beta's recent moves are 7s, maybe this works.\n\nIn Round 4, Beta did A7 B7 C6.\n\nIf I do A8 B8 C4:\n\nA8>7, B8>7, C4<6. So win A and B. Two wins. Perfect.\n\nBut what if Beta changes strategy?\n\nSuppose Beta anticipates this and puts more on A and B.\n\nFor example, if Beta does A9 B9 C2 (like Round 2).\n\nThen my A8 <9, B8 <9, C4>2. So I only win C. Lose two fields. Bad.\n\nSo risky.\n\nAlternatively, if I spread more.\n\nHow about A7 B7 C6.\n\nAgainst Beta's 7,7,6: all ties. Not good.\n\nBut if Beta varies, say A8 B8 C4.\n\nThen A7<8, B7<8, C6>4. Win only C. Bad.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative strategy: focus on two fields with 9 and 9, leaving 2.\n\n[A9 B9 C2].\n\nBut sum is 20.\n\nAgainst Beta's 7,7,6: A9>7, B9>7, C2<6. Win two. Good.\n\nAgainst Beta's 9,9,2 (Round 2): tie A and B, C2=2. So tie all? No, in Round 2, I had A10 B4 C6 vs Beta 9,9,2.\n\nWait, if both do 9,9,2: tie.\n\nBut if Beta does something else.\n\nBut Beta's recent moves have been moving away from very low C.\n\nRound 4 Beta C was 6.\n\nIf Beta does A7 B7 C6, then 9,9,2 would win A and B.\n\nBut if Beta does A10 B10 C0 (but C can't be negative, so C0 is allowed?), but total must be 20. 10+10+0=20.\n\nThen [A9 B9 C2] would lose A and B, win C. Only one win.\n\nBut is C0 a likely move? Maybe not, but possible.\n\nAnother idea: since in Round 4 I won with A9 C9, Beta might up their A and C.\n\nSuppose Beta does A8 B4 C8 for Round 5.\n\nThen if I do A7 B6 C7: lose A (7<8), win B (6>4), lose C (7<8). Only one win.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf I do A10 B2 C8: sum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta A8 B4 C8: A10>8, B2<4, C8=8. Win A, tie C. So only one win (A), need two.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, need to win two. So need > in two.\n\nLet's think of what defeated Beta's previous moves.\n\nIn Round 2: Beta did 9,9,2. I won with 10,4,6 (A and C).\n\nIn Round 4: Beta did 7,7,6. I won with 9,2,9 (A and C).\n\nSo targeting A and C with higher numbers worked.\n\nIn Round 3, I targeted B with 10, but Beta had A and C at 7, which beat my A4 and C6.\n\nSo perhaps targeting A and C is a good strategy if Beta is spreading.\n\nGiven that in Rounds 3 and 4, Beta's C was 7 and 6, which are moderate.\n\nSo for Round 5, if I put high on A and C again, say 9 and 9, but that leaves only 2 for B.\n\nWait, [A9 B2 C9].\n\nBut in Round 4, I did that and won. Will Beta adjust?\n\nIn Round 4, Beta's response to my A9 B2 C9 was A7 B7 C6.\n\nSo they lost A and C.\n\nSo for Round 5, Beta might increase A and C.\n\nSuppose Beta does A8 B4 C8.\n\nThen if I repeat A9 B2 C9:\n\nA9>8, B2<4, C9>8. So win A and C. Two wins. Good.\n\nIf Beta does A9 B2 C9 themselves, then tie.\n\nBut what's the likelihood?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta increases A and C to 9 and 7.\n\nWait, let's suppose Beta's Round 5 allocation is A8 B5 C7.\n\nSum 20.\n\nIf I do A9 B2 C9:\n\nA9>8, B2<5, C9>7. Win A and C.\n\nStill good.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does A10 B7 C3.\n\nSum 20.\n\nMy A9 <10, B2<7, C9>3. Win only C. Bad.\n\nBut is A10 B7 C3 a likely Beta move? Based on history, Beta hasn't done A10 yet. Their highest A was 9.\n\nBeta's max per field so far: A9, B9, C7.\n\nSo maybe A10 is possible, but not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the safest is to go with the strategy that worked in Rounds 2 and 4: focus on two fields with high numbers, neglect the third.\n\nIn Round 2: focused on A and C (10 and 6), neglected B (4). Worked.\n\nRound 4: focused on A and C (9 and 9), neglected B (2). Worked.\n\nRound 3: focused on B (10), neglected A (4). Didn't work because Beta covered A and C.\n\nSo perhaps continuing to focus on A and C is better, since Beta might still be vulnerable there.\n\nSo let's try A9 B2 C9 again.\n\nBut wait, in Round 4 I did that, and won. Beta might anticipate and boost A and C.\n\nIf Beta does A8 B4 C8 (sum 20), then my A9 and C9 would still win.\n\nIf Beta does A9 B2 C9, tie.\n\nBut if Beta does A10 B10 C0, but that's 20. Then I lose A and B, win C. Only one.\n\nBut is A10 B10 C0 likely? Beta hasn't done that before.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do A7 B6 C7 as in Round 3.\n\nMy A9 >7, B2 <6, C9 >7. Win A and C. Good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, vary slightly. Instead of 9,2,9, do 10,1,9. Sum 20.\n\nBut B1 is very low. If Beta puts 3 on B, still lose B.\n\nBut same issue.\n\nAlternatively, 8,3,9. Sum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta's possible 7,7,6: A8>7, B3<7, C9>6. Win A and C.\n\nGood.\n\nBut if Beta does 8 on A and C, then A8 tie, C9>8. Win C and maybe B?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a pattern in how Beta responds.\n\nAfter I did high on A and C (Round 4: A9 B2 C9), Beta did A7 B7 C6.\n\nSo they increased B to 7, kept A at 7 (lower than my 9), C at 6 (lower than my 9).\n\nFor Round 5, if I do A8 B8 C4:\n\nIf Beta continues to increase B, they might do B8.\n\nSuppose Beta does A7 B8 C5 (sum 20).\n\nThen my A8 >7, B8 =8, C4 <5. Win A, tie B. Only one win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another idea. Since the game is about winning two out of three, sometimes it's good to have one very high, one medium, one low.\n\nFor example, 11-6-3.\n\nIf Beta has less than 11 on A, I win A. And if I have more than Beta on either B or C.\n\nBut risky.\n\nAlternatively, 12-5-3.\n\nBut maybe overcommitting.\n\nAlternatively, think of the Nash equilibrium for Blotto with 3 fields and 20 troops. I recall that for symmetric Blotto games, the equilibrium involves splitting the troops in a way that covers various permutations.\n\nBut since this is only one instance and not sure about Beta's strategy, hard to apply.\n\nGiven past rounds, let's tabulate what worked.\n\nRound 2: My 10-4-6 beat Beta's 9-9-2 (won A and C)\n\nRound 4: My 9-2-9 beat Beta's 7-7-6 (won A and C)\n\nSo the pattern is high on A and C, low on B.\n\nRound 3: My 4-10-6 lost to Beta's 7-6-7 (Beta won A and C)\n\nBecause I went high on B, but Beta covered A and C.\n\nSo sticking with A and C focus seems better.\n\nTherefore, for Round 5, I'll try A9 B2 C9 again.\n\nBut wait, in Round 4 I did that. Beta might adjust.\n\nIf Beta increases A and C.\n\nSuppose Beta does A8 B4 C8.\n\nMy A9 >8, C9 >8. Win A and C.\n\nGood.\n\nIf Beta does A9 B2 C9, tie.\n\nBut even if tie, it's not a loss. But we need to win.\n\nAlternatively, make it A10 B1 C9. Sum 20.\n\nThen against Beta's possible A8 B4 C8: A10>8, B1<4, C9>8. Win A and C.\n\nAgainst Beta A9 B2 C9: A10>9, B1<2, C9=9. Win A, tie C. So one win and a tie. But to win the round, need two wins. Tie on C means only one win (A). Not enough.\n\nAh, right. So need to strictly win two.\n\nSo A10 B1 C9 vs Beta A9 B2 C9: A10>9 (win), B1<2 (lose), C9=9 (tie). So only one win. Not sufficient.\n\nSo better to have both A and C strictly greater.\n\nThus, A9 B2 C9 vs Beta A8 B4 C8: A9>8, C9>8. Two wins.\n\nIf Beta does A9 B something C9, then need to have higher than 9 on two fields, which would require at least 10 on two, sum 20+ which is impossible. So can't beat two 9s unless they have less.\n\nSo safest is to assume Beta might have 8s on A and C.\n\nThus, A9 B2 C9 would win against A8 and C8.\n\nAlternatively, A8 B something C8.\n\nWait, I think A9 B2 C9 is a solid choice based on previous success.\n\nLet me check sum: 9+2+9=20. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I'll go with [A9 B2 C9].\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out how to allocate 20 troops across A, B, C for Round 5. The goal is to win two out of three battlefields.\n\nLooking at the previous rounds might help spot a pattern in what Commander Alpha is doing.\n\nRound 1: Alpha did [A8 B8 C4] and Beta did the same, resulting in a tie. So Alpha used equal on A and B, less on C.\n\nRound 2: Alpha went [A10 B4 C6]. Beta did [A9 B9 C2] and lost. Alpha won A and C, Beta won B. So Alpha focused on A and C here.\n\nRound 3: Alpha [A4 B10 C6], Beta [A7 B6 C7]. Beta won A and C, Alpha won B. So Beta spread more evenly but higher on A and C.\n\nRound 4: Alpha [A9 B2 C9], Beta [A7 B7 C6]. Alpha won A and C, Beta won B. Alpha put high on A and C again, low on B.\n\nHmm. So in Round 2, Alpha had high A and C. Round 4, same thing: high A and C, low B. Round 1 was more balanced but still A and B high. Round 3 was B high for Alpha.\n\nWait, maybe Alpha is alternating? Or maybe they have a tendency to put more on A and C. Let's list all Alpha's allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8, B8, C4\n\nRound 2: A10, B4, C6\n\nRound 3: A4, B10, C6\n\nRound 4: A9, B2, C9\n\nSo looking at that, in Round 1, A and B high. Round 2, A high, B low. Round 3, B high. Round 4, A and C high, B very low.\n\nMaybe Alpha is trying to vary but perhaps has a pattern of sometimes putting high on two fields. In Round 4, they did A and C with 9 each, B with 2.\n\nIn Round 2, A10, C6, so maybe A and C again. Wait, Round 2: A10, B4, C6. So A highest, then C, then B.\n\nRound 3: B10, then C6 and A4.\n\nRound 4: A9 and C9, B2.\n\nSo perhaps Alpha sometimes pairs A and C, sometimes B and another. Hmm.\n\nBut in Round 4, they put 9 on A and 9 on C, which is very high, leaving B with 2. So maybe they're trying to win two fields by putting high on two and low on one.\n\nIn Round 2, they put 10 on A, 6 on C, so maybe targeting A and C again.\n\nWait, Round 2: Alpha A10, B4, C6. So they won A (10 vs Beta's 9), lost B (4 vs 9), won C (6 vs 2). So they took A and C.\n\nRound 4: Alpha A9, B2, C9. Beta had A7, B7, C6. So Alpha won A and C again.\n\nSo in both Round 2 and 4, Alpha focused on A and C. Round 1 was a tie where both did similar. Round 3, Alpha focused on B (10), and Beta won A and C.\n\nSo maybe Alpha's strategy is sometimes to go for A and C, and sometimes for B and another. But in the last two rounds where they won (Round 2 and 4), they targeted A and C.\n\nWait, Round 2 and 4: Alpha won by taking A and C. Round 3, Alpha took B but Beta took A and C.\n\nSo perhaps Alpha is likely to go for A and C again in Round 5. If that's the case, Beta should try to counter that.\n\nBut how? If Alpha is putting high on A and C, Beta needs to either:\n\n1. Outbid on two fields, but since they have to allocate 20, they need to choose where to focus.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha is using a strategy of sometimes putting high on two fields. Let's see their allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8, B8, C4 → two high on A and B.\n\nRound 2: A10, B4, C6 → high on A, medium on C.\n\nRound 3: A4, B10, C6 → high on B, medium on C.\n\nRound 4: A9, B2, C9 → high on A and C.\n\nSo it's a bit inconsistent, but maybe they are varying which two fields they focus on. Round 1: A,B; Round 2: A,C; Round 3: B,C; Round 4: A,C.\n\nHmm. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they are following a pattern of shifting focus.\n\nBut for Round 5, what can Beta do?\n\nBeta's previous allocations:\n\nRound 1: [8,8,4] - same as Alpha, tie.\n\nRound 2: [9,9,2] - lost because Alpha had 10 on A, 4 on B, 6 on C. So Beta's 9 on A lost to 10, but won B (9 vs4), but lost C (2 vs6). So Beta only won one.\n\nRound 3: Beta did [7,6,7], which beat Alpha's [4,10,6]. So Beta won A (7>4), C (7>6), lost B (6<10). So two wins.\n\nRound 4: Beta did [7,7,6]. Alpha had [9,2,9], so Beta won B (7>2), but lost A and C. So only one win.\n\nSo in Round 3, Beta's strategy of having moderate on all but slightly higher on A and C worked.\n\nIn Round 4, Beta's allocation was 7,7,6 which wasn't enough against Alpha's 9,2,9.\n\nSo maybe to counter Alpha's tendency to sometimes go high on two fields, Beta should try to cover two fields.\n\nAssuming Alpha might again go high on A and C (as in Round 2 and 4), Beta needs to either:\n\n- Outbid on A and B, or B and C, or A and C.\n\nBut if Alpha is putting 9 on A and 9 on C (as in Round 4), then Beta would need at least 10 on two fields, but with 20 total, that's hard. Wait, 10+10=20, but they have three fields, so maybe 10 on two fields would require 0 on the third, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha does something like 9, x, 9, then Beta could do 10 on B and split the remaining 10 on A and C. Wait, but 10 on B, then 5 and 5 on A and C. But if Alpha has 9 on A and C, then 5 would lose both. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Round 4, Alpha had 9,2,9. Beta had 7,7,6. So Beta lost A (7<9), won B (7>2), lost C (6<9). So only B won.\n\nTo beat that, Beta would need to have at least 10 on A and/or C. But with 20 points, if Beta puts 10 on A and 10 on C, that's 20, leaving B as 0. But then if Alpha has high on A and C, but maybe not 10 each.\n\nWait, in Round 4, Alpha had 9 on A and C, so if Beta does 10 on A and 10 on C, but that's 20, but then B is 0. However, if Alpha has 9 on A and C, then Beta would win both A and C (10>9), but lose B (0<2). So two wins, which would win the round.\n\nBut is Alpha likely to do 9,2,9 again? If so, then [A10 B0 C10] would work. But maybe Alpha changes.\n\nAlternatively, in Round 2, Alpha did A10, B4, C6. If Beta does 11 on A, but that's not possible because total is 20. Wait, 10 on A would tie with Alpha's 10. But to win, you need more. So if Alpha has 10 on A, Beta needs 11 to win A, but with 20 total, that's difficult if focusing on two fields.\n\nWait, but in Colonel Blotto, you need to win two fields. So maybe a strategy of going very high on one field and moderate on another.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Beta's successful Round 3: [7,6,7] against Alpha's [4,10,6]. So Beta won A and C by having more than Alpha there.\n\nSo in Round 3, Alpha focused on B (10), so Beta put less on B and covered A and C.\n\nSo maybe Beta should anticipate where Alpha is putting their high numbers and adjust.\n\nGiven that in Round 4, Alpha put high on A and C, maybe in Round 5 they might switch to focus on B again, as they did in Round 3.\n\nIn Round 3, Alpha did B10, so Beta did 6 on B, but won A and C.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha might alternate.\n\nLooking at Alpha's pattern:\n\nRound 1: Balanced (8,8,4)\n\nRound 2: High A (10), medium C (6)\n\nRound 3: High B (10), medium C (6)\n\nRound 4: High A and C (9 each), low B (2)\n\nSo maybe Round 5, they go high on B and C? Or high on A and B?\n\nNot sure. Another approach: try to find a mixed strategy that is robust.\n\nA common strategy in Blotto is to allocate in a way that covers multiple possibilities.\n\nFor example, using a distribution like 7,7,6 (as Beta did in Round 4) but maybe adjusted.\n\nWait, in Round 3, 7,6,7 worked. Round 4, same approach but Alpha changed to 9,2,9 which beat it.\n\nSo perhaps varying the allocation to prevent predictability.\n\nAnother idea: since the total is 20, a common tactic is to use numbers that sum to 20, with two fields getting higher numbers.\n\nWait, possible combinations:\n\nIf Beta wants to win A and B, they need to have more than Alpha on both. But without knowing Alpha's move, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, use a strategy that covers two possible high fields.\n\nWait, let's consider possible allocations that can win two fields against common patterns.\n\nFor example, if Beta allocates [8,8,4], which was Round 1. But if Alpha does something else, it might not work.\n\nAlternatively, [6,7,7] as in Round 3. Or [7,7,6] as in Round 4.\n\nWait, perhaps shifting the numbers slightly.\n\nAnother angle: in Round 4, Alpha's allocation was [9,2,9]. To beat that, Beta needs at least 10 on two fields. But 10+10=20, so [10,0,10] would win A and C. But if Alpha does something else, like [4,10,6] as in Round 3, then [10,0,10] would lose A (10 vs4, wait no: 10>4 so win A, lose B (0<10), win C (10>6). So two wins. Wait, that would actually work against Round 3's allocation.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nIf Beta does [10,0,10], against Round 3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nA: 10 >4 → win\n\nB: 0 <10 → lose\n\nC:10 >6 → win\n\nTotal: 2 wins. So Beta would win.\n\nSimilarly, against Round 4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:10>9, C:10>9, so two wins.\n\nBut against Round 2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA:10 vs10 → tie, B:0<4, C:10>6. So win C, tie A, lose B. Only one win (since tie doesn't count as a win), so Round would be a tie? Wait, no: to win the round, need to win two fields. If two fields are tied, then it's a tie round.\n\nWait, in Colonel Blotto, a tie on a field means no one wins that field. So to win the round, you need to win two fields.\n\nSo if Beta does [10,0,10] against Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA: tie (10-10), B: Beta 0 < Alpha 4 → Alpha wins B, C: Beta 10 > Alpha 6 → Beta wins C.\n\nSo Beta only wins one field (C), Alpha wins one (B), A is tie. So no one wins the round? Wait, but in the game description, it says \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So you need to win two out of three. If it's 1-1-1, then tie.\n\nIn the previous rounds, when both had same allocation, it was a tie.\n\nSo in the scenario where Beta does [10,0,10] vs Alpha [10,4,6], Beta only wins C, Alpha wins B, A is tie. So no one has two wins → tie.\n\nBut in Round 2, Beta did [9,9,2] and Alpha [10,4,6], so:\n\nA: 9<10 → Alpha wins\n\nB:9>4 → Beta wins\n\nC:2<6 → Alpha wins\n\nSo Alpha won two fields (A and C), so Alpha wins the round.\n\nSo if Beta uses [10,0,10], against Alpha's Round 2 allocation, it's a tie on A, but Beta would win C, but lose B. So only one win for Beta. Not good.\n\nBut against Round 4's allocation [9,2,9], [10,0,10] would win A and C.\n\nSo this strategy works against some allocations but not others.\n\nBut if Alpha is likely to repeat their Round 4 strategy (high A and C), then [10,0,10] would be good. But if they switch to something else, it might not.\n\nAnother possible allocation: [0,10,10]. Similar idea, but focusing on B and C.\n\nBut looking at Alpha's Round 3, where they had B10, then [0,10,10] would lose B (tie), but win C. Wait:\n\nAlpha [4,10,6] vs Beta [0,10,10]:\n\nA: 0<4 → Alpha\n\nB:10=10 → tie\n\nC:10>6 → Beta\n\nSo Beta only wins C → not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, Beta could do [7,6,7] as in Round 3, which worked against Alpha's B focus.\n\nBut in Round 4, when Alpha focused on A and C, [7,7,6] (similar) didn't work.\n\nWait, Round 3 Beta was [7,6,7], which beat Alpha's [4,10,6]. So A:7>4, B:6<10, C:7>6. Two wins.\n\nRound 4 Beta was [7,7,6] against Alpha's [9,2,9]. So A:7<9, B:7>2, C:6<9. Only one win.\n\nSo if Beta assumes Alpha might go for high B again (like Round 3), then [7,6,7] could work. But if Alpha does A and C high again, it might not.\n\nAlternatively, a more balanced approach: [6,7,7], which is similar but shifted.\n\nWait, but what if Beta tries to anticipate Alpha's next move based on previous.\n\nLet's list all Alpha's allocations:\n\nR1: A8 B8 C4\n\nR2: A10 B4 C6\n\nR3: A4 B10 C6\n\nR4: A9 B2 C9\n\nLooking for patterns:\n\nA: 8,10,4,9 → average around 7.75\n\nB:8,4,10,2 → average 6\n\nC:4,6,6,9 → average 6.25\n\nBut not sure. Maybe Alpha is trying to vary which field gets the lowest.\n\nIn R1: C lowest (4)\n\nR2: B lowest (4)\n\nR3: A lowest (4)\n\nR4: B lowest (2)\n\nSo maybe cycling through which field is weakest.\n\nR1: C low\n\nR2: B low\n\nR3: A low\n\nR4: B low (again?)\n\nNot a clear cycle. Alternatively, R1: C4, R2: B4, R3: A4, R4: B2. Maybe next R5: C low?\n\nIf that's the case, then Alpha might set C as the low field in R5. So Alpha might allocate high on A and B, low on C.\n\nIf so, then Beta should focus on winning A and B, or A and C, but if C is low for Alpha, then Beta could win C easily but need another.\n\nWait, if Alpha's allocation for R5 is high on A and B, low on C (e.g., A9, B9, C2), then Beta needs to beat on two of them.\n\nIf Beta does, say, A10, B8, C2. But total would be 20. Wait, 10+8+2=20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's hypothetical A9, B9, C2:\n\nA:10>9, B:8<9, C:2=2. So Beta wins A, ties C, loses B. Only one win. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, Beta does A8, B10, C2. Same issue.\n\nWait, to win two fields against Alpha's A9, B9, C2:\n\nBeta needs to have >9 on two fields. But 10+10=20, so A10, B10, C0. Then:\n\nA:10>9, B:10>9, C:0<2. So two wins. That would work.\n\nBut if Alpha actually has C as low, then [10,10,0] would win A and B.\n\nBut if Alpha instead has a different allocation, like R4's A9,B2,C9, then [10,10,0] would win A (10>9), lose B (10>2, wait no: Beta's B is 10 vs Alpha's 2 → Beta wins B. C:0<9. So Beta wins A and B → two wins. Oh! Wait, that would actually work against R4's allocation too.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nBeta [10,10,0] vs Alpha R4 [9,2,9]:\n\nA:10>9 → win\n\nB:10>2 → win\n\nC:0<9 → lose\n\nSo Beta wins two fields. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, against R2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nBeta [10,10,0]:\n\nA:10=10 → tie\n\nB:10>4 → win\n\nC:0<6 → lose\n\nSo only one win (B), which isn't enough. Tie on A, so Beta only wins B. Not sufficient.\n\nBut against R3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nBeta [10,10,0]:\n\nA:10>4 → win\n\nB:10=10 → tie\n\nC:0<6 → lose\n\nSo only one win (A). Not enough.\n\nHmm. So [10,10,0] works well against allocations where Alpha has low on B (like R4), but not when Alpha has high on B (R3) or balanced.\n\nAnother angle: what if Beta uses [8,7,5]. Wait, sum is 20? 8+7+5=20. Yes.\n\nBut not sure. Let's think of other strategies.\n\nWait, another common strategy is to use numbers that are just above possible common allocations.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in Round 3, when Alpha went high on B (10), Beta won by having 7 on A and 7 on C.\n\nIn Round 4, when Alpha went high on A and C (9 each), Beta's 7 on A and 6 on C wasn't enough.\n\nSo maybe for Round 5, Beta should do higher on two fields, say 9 on A and 9 on C, but that's 18, leaving 2 on B. But that's what Alpha did in Round 4. If Beta does that, and Alpha varies, it might not work.\n\nWait, but if Beta does [9,2,9], and Alpha does something else, like focusing on B, then Beta would win A and C if Alpha has less than 9 there.\n\nBut in Round 4, Alpha did exactly that, so it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, Beta could try [8,4,8], summing to 20. If Alpha is going for two fields with 9s, 8 might not be enough.\n\nWait, perhaps aiming for 9 on two fields: 9+9+2=20.\n\nSo [9,9,2]. Let's see how that would have performed in previous rounds.\n\nAgainst R1 Alpha [8,8,4]:\n\nA:9>8, B:9>8, C:2<4. So two wins → Beta wins. Good.\n\nR2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA:9<10, B:9>4, C:2<6. Only B → lose.\n\nR3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nA:9>4, B:9<10, C:2<6. Only A → lose.\n\nR4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:9=9, B:9>2, C:2<9. So B is win, A and C tie. Only one win → tie round.\n\nHmm, mixed results.\n\nAlternatively, [7,6,7] worked in R3 but not R4.\n\nWhat if Beta does [6,8,6]. Sum 20. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since in R4, Alpha did B2, maybe they'll do a low on a different field in R5. If the lows were C, B, A, B in R1-R4, maybe R5 low is C.\n\nSo Alpha might have high on A and B, low C.\n\nThus, Beta should aim to win A and B.\n\nTo win A and B against, say, Alpha's hypothetical A9, B9, C2.\n\nBeta needs >9 on two fields. As before, [10,10,0] would work.\n\nBut as seen earlier, this fails if Alpha has high on one field.\n\nAlternatively, Beta could do [11,8,1], but 11+8+1=20.\n\nAgainst Alpha A9,B9,C2:\n\nA:11>9, B:8<9, C:1<2. Only A → no good.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, but if Beta assumes Alpha will have two fields at 9, then 10 on two fields is needed.\n\nBut total 20, so [10,10,0].\n\nAlternatively, [9,10,1], sum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha [9,9,2]:\n\nA:9=9, B:10>9, C:1<2. Only B → no.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the average allocations.\n\nAlpha's A: (8+10+4+9)/4 = 31/4 =7.75\n\nB: (8+4+10+2)/4=24/4=6\n\nC: (4+6+6+9)/4=25/4=6.25\n\nSo maybe Alpha's average is around 7-8 on A, 6 on B and C.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAnother approach: use a strategy that covers two fields with 7 or more.\n\nFor example, [7,7,6] as before.\n\nBut in R4, it failed because Alpha had 9s.\n\nSo maybe increase to [8,7,5]. Sum 20.\n\nAgainst R4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:8<9, B:7>2, C:5<9. Only B. Not good.\n\n[9,7,4]:\n\nA:9 vs9 (tie), B:7>2, C:4<9. Still only B.\n\n[10,7,3]:\n\nA:10>9, B:7>2, so two wins. That would work against R4.\n\nSum:10+7+3=20.\n\nLet's check against previous Alpha allocations.\n\nR1 Alpha [8,8,4]:\n\nA:10>8, B:7<8, C:3<4. Only A. Not enough.\n\nR2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA:10=10, B:7>4, C:3<6. Only B. Not enough.\n\nR3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nA:10>4, B:7<10, C:3<6. Only A.\n\nR4: works.\n\nSo only good against R4-type allocations.\n\nBut if Alpha repeats R4, then [10,7,3] would win A and B.\n\nBut if Alpha varies, might not.\n\nAlternatively, [7,10,3].\n\nAgainst R4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:7<9, B:10>2, C:3<9. Only B.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if Beta assumes Alpha will again do low on B, as in R2 and R4.\n\nIn R2: B4, R4: B2. So maybe B is often low.\n\nIf Beta focuses on winning A and C, assuming B is low for Alpha.\n\nBut to win A and C, Beta needs to outbid Alpha there.\n\nIf Alpha's B is low, their A and C might be higher.\n\nIn R4, Alpha had A9, C9.\n\nSo if Beta does [10,1,9], sum 20.\n\nWait 10+1+9=20.\n\nAgainst R4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:10>9, B:1<2, C:9=9. So win A, tie C. Only one win.\n\nNot enough.\n\n[10,0,10] as before would win A and C against R4.\n\nBut as discussed earlier, fails against R2 and R3.\n\nBut maybe the best chance is to go for [10,0,10], assuming Alpha might repeat R4's strategy.\n\nGiven that in the last round (R4), Alpha won by doing A9,B2,C9, it's possible they might do a similar allocation again, or switch.\n\nBut since they won R4 with that, maybe they'll try a variation.\n\nAlternatively, they might switch to focusing on B again.\n\nIt's a gamble.\n\nAnother thought: in R3, when Alpha focused on B (10), Beta won by covering A and C with 7 each.\n\nIn R4, Alpha switched to A and C high, and Beta lost.\n\nSo for R5, Beta might want to cover B and one other.\n\nIf Beta does [5,10,5], sum 20.\n\nAgainst R4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:5<9, B:10>2, C:5<9. Only B → no.\n\n[6,10,4]:\n\nSame issue.\n\n[8,10,2]:\n\nA:8<9, B:10>2, C:2<9. Only B.\n\nNot enough.\n\nUnless Beta can win B and one other.\n\nIf Alpha has B low (like 2), then to win another field, Beta needs to have more than Alpha on either A or C.\n\nIf Alpha has A9 and C9, Beta would need at least 10 on one of them.\n\nSo for example, [10,9,1].\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst R4:\n\nA:10>9, B:9>2, so two wins. Yes!\n\nLet's verify:\n\nBeta [10,9,1] vs Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:10>9 → win\n\nB:9>2 → win\n\nC:1<9 → lose\n\nTwo wins. Perfect.\n\nNow check against previous Alpha allocations to see if it's robust.\n\nR1 Alpha [8,8,4]:\n\nA:10>8, B:9>8, C:1<4. Two wins. Good.\n\nR2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA:10=10, B:9>4, C:1<6. Only B. Not enough (needs two wins).\n\nR3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nA:10>4, B:9<10, C:1<6. Only A. Not enough.\n\nSo it works against R1 and R4, but not R2 and R3.\n\nBut if Alpha is likely to repeat R4's strategy (high A and C, low B), then [10,9,1] is good.\n\nAlternatively, [9,10,1] sum 20.\n\nAgainst R4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:9=9, B:10>2, C:1<9. Only B. Not good.\n\nWhereas [10,9,1] wins A and B.\n\nAnother option: [11,8,1] but 11+8+1=20.\n\nAgainst R4:\n\nA:11>9, B:8>2, two wins.\n\nR2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA:11>10, B:8>4, two wins. Even better.\n\nR3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nA:11>4, B:8<10, C:1<6. Only A. Not enough.\n\nR1 Alpha [8,8,4]:\n\nA:11>8, B:8=8, C:1<4. Only A. Not enough.\n\nHmm, mixed.\n\nWait, [11,8,1] would beat R2 and R4, which are the ones where Alpha focused on A and C.\n\nBut in R3, when Alpha focused on B, it fails.\n\nBut if in R5, Alpha is likely to focus on A and C again (since they did that in R2 and R4), then [11,8,1] could be good.\n\nBut can we go higher than 10? Yes, as long as sum is 20.\n\nWait, another allocation: [12,7,1].\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst R4 Alpha [9,2,9]:\n\nA:12>9, B:7>2 → two wins.\n\nR2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA:12>10, B:7>4 → two wins.\n\nR3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nA:12>4, B:7<10 → only A.\n\nR1 Alpha [8,8,4]:\n\nA:12>8, B:7<8 → only A.\n\nSo if Alpha is doing A and C high (R2 and R4), this works. If they do B high (R3), it doesn't.\n\nGiven that Alpha won the last round (R4) with A and C high, it's plausible they might try a similar strategy again, perhaps adjusting the numbers slightly.\n\nIf Beta assumes that, then [12,7,1] could be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, [10,7,3] as before:\n\nR4: A10>9, B7>2 → win two.\n\nR2: A10=10, B7>4 → only B. Not enough.\n\nBut if Alpha's R5 allocation is similar to R4, then [10,7,3] works.\n\nAnother angle: what's the minimal needed to beat R4's allocation.\n\nAlpha had A9, B2, C9.\n\nTo win two fields, Beta needs:\n\nEither:\n\n- A>9 and B>2 (but since B is 2, any B>=3 would win B. But to get A>9, need A>=10.\n\nSo if Beta does A10, B3, C7 (sum 20), then:\n\nA:10>9, B:3>2, C:7<9. Two wins.\n\nYes.\n\nOr A10, B4, C6: same idea.\n\nBut the exact numbers can vary as long as A>9, B>2, and sum to 20.\n\nThe minimal for A is 10, B is 3.\n\nSo 10+3=13, leaving 7 for C.\n\nSo [10,3,7].\n\nCheck:\n\nA:10>9, B:3>2, C:7<9. Two wins (A and B).\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly, [10,4,6], [11,3,6], etc.\n\nNow, how would [10,3,7] fare against previous Alpha allocations?\n\nR1 Alpha [8,8,4]:\n\nA:10>8, B:3<8, C:7>4. Two wins (A and C). Good.\n\nR2 Alpha [10,4,6]:\n\nA:10=10, B:3<4, C:7>6. Only C. Not enough.\n\nR3 Alpha [4,10,6]:\n\nA:10>4, B:3<10, C:7>6. Two wins (A and C). Good.\n\nR4: works as intended.\n\nSo [10,3,7] would have won R1, R3, R4, and lost R2.\n\nThat's pretty robust.\n\nIn R2, it would have only won C (7>6), while A tied and B lost. So only one win.\n\nBut overall, this allocation seems strong against various patterns.\n\nAnother example: [10,3,7].\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, [9,4,7] but A9 vs Alpha's possible A9 would tie.\n\nSo better to have A10.\n\nSo to ensure winning A against Alpha's likely 9, set A=10.\n\nB=3 to win against low B (like 2).\n\nC=7, which would beat Alpha's C if it's 6 or lower.\n\nIn R3, Alpha's C was 6, so 7>6.\n\nIn R1, Alpha's C was 4, so 7>4.\n\nIn R2, Alpha's C was 6, so 7>6.\n\nOnly in R4, Alpha's C was 9, so 7<9, but Beta wins A and B there.\n\nSo [10,3,7] seems like a solid choice.\n\nSum is 20 (10+3+7=20).\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n- A:10, B:3, C:7.\n\nYes.\n\nAgainst all previous Alpha allocations:\n\nR1: A10>8, B3<8, C7>4 → wins A,C.\n\nR2: A10=10, B3<4, C7>6 → wins C only.\n\nR3: A10>4, B3<10, C7>6 → wins A,C.\n\nR4: A10>9, B3>2, C7<9 → wins A,B.\n\nSo it wins three out of four previous rounds, only losing R2.\n\nSince R2 was a different allocation (Alpha had C6), but in R5, if Alpha repeats R4's strategy or uses something similar to R1/R3, this would work.\n\nGiven that Alpha won R4 with a high A and C strategy, they might vary, but [10,3,7] covers several scenarios.\n\nAnother option is [10,2,8], but B=2 would tie with Alpha's R4 B=2. So need B>=3.\n\nYes, B must be at least 3 to beat Alpha's B=2.\n\nSo [10,3,7] is good.\n\nAlternatively, [11,2,7] but B=2 would tie Alpha's R4 B=2, so only one win (A and C? C=7<9, so no: A11>9, B2=2, C7<9. Only A. Not good.\n\nThus, B needs to be >2, so minimum 3.\n\nSo [10,3,7] seems optimal.\n\nAnother check: if Alpha does something new, like A5,B5,C10.\n\nBeta [10,3,7]: A wins, B loses, C loses (7<10). Only one win. But it's hard to cover all possibilities.\n\nBut given the history, focusing on countering the recent successful strategy of Alpha (R4) makes sense.\n\nThus, I think [A10 B3 C7] is a strong choice for Round 5.\n",

        "reasoning": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how to allocate 20 troops across A, B, C for Round 6 of Colonel Blotto. So far, the game has had five rounds. Let me recap what's happened so far to spot any patterns or strategies from both sides.\n\nRound 1: Both played [8,8,4]. Tie. So maybe Beta copied Alpha or they both used a similar strategy.\n\nRound 2: Alpha did [10,4,6], Beta [9,9,2]. Alpha won because they took A (10>9) and C (6>2), Beta took B (9>4). So two fields for Alpha.\n\nRound 3: Alpha [4,10,6], Beta [7,6,7]. Beta won A (7>4) and C (7>6), Alpha took B (10>6). So Beta won two fields.\n\nRound 4: Alpha [9,2,9], Beta [7,7,6]. Alpha won A (9>7) and C (9>6), Beta took B (7>2). Alpha won.\n\nRound 5: Alpha again [9,2,9], Beta [10,3,7]. Beta took A (10>9) and C (7>9? Wait no, 7 vs 9. Wait, Alpha had C:9, Beta C:7. So Alpha's C is 9 which is higher than Beta's 7. Wait, but the result says Beta won Round 5. Let me check again.\n\nWait Round 5: Alpha [9,2,9], Beta [10,3,7]. So A: 9 vs 10 → Beta wins A. B: 2 vs 3 → Beta wins B. C:9 vs7 → Alpha wins C. So Beta took two fields (A and B), so Beta wins. Oh right, so Beta won Round 5 because they got two fields.\n\nSo looking at Beta's allocations:\n\nRound 1: [8,8,4]\n\nRound 2: [9,9,2]\n\nRound 3: [7,6,7]\n\nRound 4: [7,7,6]\n\nRound 5: [10,3,7]\n\nHmm. Trying to see a pattern. Maybe Beta is varying their strategy. Let's list Beta's moves:\n\nR1: A8 B8 C4\n\nR2: A9 B9 C2\n\nR3: A7 B6 C7\n\nR4: A7 B7 C6\n\nR5: A10 B3 C7\n\nSo Beta seems to sometimes concentrate on two fields, sometimes spread out. In R2, they put 9 and 9 on A and B, low on C. In R3, more balanced but A and C higher. R4: A7 B7 C6. R5: high on A, low on B, medium on C.\n\nAlpha's previous moves:\n\nR1: [8,8,4]\n\nR2: [10,4,6]\n\nR3: [4,10,6]\n\nR4: [9,2,9]\n\nR5: [9,2,9]\n\nSo Alpha in R4 and R5 used the same [9,2,9], which worked in R4 but failed in R5 because Beta adjusted to put 10 on A and 3 on B (so B:2 vs 3, Beta wins B as well as A). So maybe Beta noticed Alpha's pattern of high on A and C, low on B, and countered by putting more on A and B.\n\nNow, for Round 6, need to decide a new allocation. Since Beta has seen Alpha's [9,2,9] twice, probably will counter again. So maybe avoid that pattern.\n\nLooking at Beta's recent moves: R5 was [10,3,7]. Maybe Beta expects Alpha to go high on A and C again, so might put even more on A, or adjust B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Beta is trying to predict and counter. Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nIn Blotto, common strategies include splitting troops to win two fields, often by concentrating on two and sacrificing one. Since total is 20, a common split might be like 7-7-6, 8-8-4, 9-9-2, etc., but depends.\n\nBut since it's a repeated game, need to mix it up to prevent opponent from predicting.\n\nAlpha's previous allocations:\n\nR1: 8,8,4\n\nR2:10,4,6\n\nR3:4,10,6\n\nR4:9,2,9\n\nR5:9,2,9\n\nSo in R2 and R3, Alpha shifted high to A then B, then in R4/R5 focused on A and C.\n\nBeta's responses:\n\nAfter R1 tie, in R2 Beta did 9,9,2. Maybe trying to win A and B by putting high there.\n\nIn R3, Beta did 7,6,7, which beat Alpha's 4,10,6 (since Beta's A=7>4, C=7>6, so Beta wins two).\n\nIn R4, Beta did 7,7,6, which lost to Alpha's 9,2,9 (Alpha's A and C higher).\n\nIn R5, Beta adjusted to 10,3,7 to beat Alpha's repeat of 9,2,9.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is reacting to Alpha's previous move. For example, after Alpha played [9,2,9] in R4, Beta in R5 put 10 on A (to beat 9), 3 on B (which beats 2), and 7 on C (but 7 <9, so Alpha wins C). Wait, but in R5, Beta's C was 7 vs Alpha's 9, so Alpha wins C. But Beta won A and B, so two fields.\n\nSo Beta's strategy might be to observe Alpha's allocation and shift to beat two fields.\n\nSo if Alpha repeats a strategy, Beta can counter. So for Round 6, Alpha should avoid repeating R4/R5's [9,2,9].\n\nWhat's a good counter to Beta's last move (R5: [10,3,7])?\n\nIf Beta did [10,3,7] last time, maybe they'll adjust. But since it's simultaneous, Alpha doesn't know Beta's next move. But can assume Beta might expect Alpha to change tactics.\n\nPossible approach: since Beta beat [9,2,9] by going 10 on A and 3 on B, maybe next Alpha should put more on B and C, or A and B.\n\nAlternative strategies:\n\n- High on B and C, low on A. For example, A:4, B:10, C:6 (like R3). But in R3, Beta did [7,6,7], so Beta won A and C. Wait, in R3, Alpha's B was 10 which beat Beta's 6, but Beta won A and C. So if Alpha does similar, need to see what Beta might do.\n\nAlternatively, spread more evenly. Like 7,7,6. But Beta used that in R4.\n\nWait, R4 Beta did [7,7,6], and Alpha won with [9,2,9]. So if Alpha uses [7,7,6], Beta might counter with something else.\n\nAnother idea: since Beta has been varying, perhaps use an asymmetric allocation. For example, A:5, B:10, C:5. But sum is 20. Wait 5+10+5=20. But would that work? If Beta expects high on A/C, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, A:6, B:8, C:6. Sum 20.\n\nWait, but need to win two fields. So perhaps allocate more to two fields such that likely to exceed Beta's allocation there.\n\nBut without knowing Beta's move, it's tricky.\n\nLooking at Beta's history:\n\nR1:8,8,4\n\nR2:9,9,2\n\nR3:7,6,7\n\nR4:7,7,6\n\nR5:10,3,7\n\nSo Beta's allocations:\n\nA: 8,9,7,7,10 → tends to be around 7-10, with a spike to 10 in R5.\n\nB:8,9,6,7,3 → decreasing trend? From 8 to 3.\n\nC:4,2,7,6,7 → variable.\n\nIn R5, Beta put 3 on B, which was enough to beat Alpha's 2. So maybe Beta thinks Alpha will keep B low.\n\nSo for Round 6, if Alpha increases B, maybe can take B and another field.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A:7, B:10, C:3. Sum 20. Then, if Beta again does low B (like 3), Alpha's B=10 would win. But what about A and C? If Beta uses R5's A=10, then A:7 <10, so Beta wins A. C:3 vs Beta's 7 → Beta wins C. So Alpha only wins B, which isn't enough.\n\nAlternatively, A:5, B:10, C:5. If Beta's A is 10 (like R5), then A:5 <10. B:10 vs Beta's B=3 → win. C:5 vs Beta's C=7 → lose. So only B won. Not good.\n\nNeed to win two. So maybe target B and C.\n\nSuppose Beta might go high on A again (since they did 10 in R5), so Alpha could put less on A and more on B and C.\n\nSay A:4, B:9, C:7. Sum 20.\n\nIf Beta does A:10 again, then A is lost. B:9 vs if Beta's B is low (like 3), then win B. C:7 vs Beta's C=7 (if same as R5), tie? But need to win two. If C is 7 vs 7, tie, so only B is won. Not enough.\n\nWait, need two wins. So if A is lost, then need to win B and C.\n\nSo allocate B and C sufficiently high.\n\nSuppose Beta's likely moves: After R5, maybe Beta thinks Alpha will up B, so Beta might increase B.\n\nBut hard to predict.\n\nAlternative approach: use a strategy that's worked before but adjusted.\n\nIn R2, Alpha did [10,4,6] and won. Beta had [9,9,2]. So Alpha won A (10>9) and C (6>2), lost B.\n\nIn R4, [9,2,9] won against Beta's [7,7,6].\n\nBut R5, same [9,2,9] lost to [10,3,7].\n\nSo perhaps varying between different allocations.\n\nAnother idea: since Beta's B allocations have been decreasing (8,9,6,7,3), maybe B is a good field to target now. If Beta continues low on B, putting more there could win it.\n\nBut in R5, Beta's B was 3, which beat Alpha's 2. If Alpha puts, say, 6 on B, that might secure B if Beta still does low.\n\nAssuming Beta might expect Alpha to increase B, Beta might put more on B. But it's a guessing game.\n\nPossible allocation: A:8, B:6, C:6. Sum 20. But then if Beta does like R5 [10,3,7], then A:8 <10 (lose), B:6>3 (win), C:6 <7 (lose). Only one win.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother angle: in R3, Alpha did [4,10,6], Beta [7,6,7]. Alpha lost A and C, won B. So if Alpha does similar but adjust C higher.\n\nSay A:4, B:9, C:7. Sum 20. Against Beta's R5 [10,3,7]: A lose, B win (9>3), C tie (7=7). Still only one win.\n\nHmm. Need two wins. So need to beat Beta in two fields.\n\nSuppose Beta uses a similar strategy to R5 but adjusted. If Beta thinks Alpha will go high on B, Beta might increase B.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might return to a balanced approach like R3 or R4.\n\nWait, Beta's R4 was [7,7,6], which lost to [9,2,9]. So if Alpha uses [8,8,4] again (like R1), would that work? Against Beta's possible [7,7,6], Alpha's A:8>7, B:8>7, so win two. But if Beta anticipates that, they might adjust.\n\nBut R1 was a tie because both did [8,8,4]. So if Alpha does [8,8,4] again, and Beta does something else...\n\nWait, Beta's R2 was [9,9,2], so if Alpha does [8,8,4], then A:8<9, B:8<9, C:4>2 → only C win. Bad.\n\nSo [8,8,4] is risky if Beta goes high on A and B.\n\nAlternative idea: use [7,10,3]. Let's see. If Beta does R5-like [10, x, y], then A:7<10 (lose), B:10 vs maybe Beta's B=3 → win, C:3 vs 7 → lose. Only B win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if Alpha does [5, 10, 5]. Against Beta R5: A lose, B win, C lose. Same issue.\n\nWait, need two wins. So perhaps target A and B.\n\nIf Beta is likely to put high on A (like 10), then hard to beat A. Unless Alpha also puts high on A.\n\nBut in R5, Beta did 10 on A. If Alpha does 11 on A, but total is 20. 11 on A leaves 9 for B and C. Say [11,5,4]. If Beta has A=10, then Alpha wins A. Then need to win either B or C. If Beta's B=3, then 5>3 → win B. So two wins (A and B). That could work.\n\nBut allocating 11 on A: is that wise? Let's check.\n\nSuppose Alpha does [11,5,4].\n\nAgainst Beta's R5 [10,3,7]: A:11>10 (win), B:5>3 (win), C:4<7 (lose). So two wins, Alpha wins round.\n\nBut will Beta change their strategy? If Beta thinks Alpha will go high on A again, they might increase A beyond 11. But 11 is already high, and total troops are 20. Beta would have to put 12 on A, leaving 8 for B and C.\n\nBut Beta might not expect Alpha to go that high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a safer high A like 10.\n\nWait, in R2 Alpha did 10 on A and won. But in R5, Beta countered with 10 on A.\n\nAnother approach: randomize allocations to prevent predictability. But since it's a human player (or AI with pattern recognition), need to be unpredictable.\n\nLooking at all previous allocations from both sides, what hasn't been used much?\n\nFor example, in R3 Alpha used [4,10,6], which is low A, high B.\n\nMaybe try a different permutation, like [6,4,10], high on C.\n\nIf Beta is expecting high on A and C (like R4/R5), then putting high on C might still work if Beta doesn't adjust.\n\nWait, in R5, Beta put 7 on C against Alpha's 9. So if Alpha puts even higher on C, say 10, but then need to allocate others.\n\nExample: [5,5,10]. Sum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta R5 [10,3,7]: A:5<10, B:5>3, C:10>7. So win B and C → two wins. Good.\n\nBut if Beta adjusts C higher, say to 8, then C:10>8 still wins.\n\nBut if Beta anticipates high C, they might put more there.\n\nAlternatively, [4,6,10]. Similar idea.\n\nBut let's think about Beta's possible moves.\n\nIf Beta thinks Alpha might go high on C again (since R4/R5 had high C), Beta might increase C.\n\nIn R5, Beta's C was 7. If Beta ups C to 8 or 9.\n\nSuppose Beta does [9,4,7] next. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, another strategy: the \"divide and conquer\" with 7-7-6.\n\nWait, Alpha hasn't used 7-7-6 yet. Let's see:\n\nIf Alpha does [7,7,6].\n\nAgainst Beta's R5 [10,3,7]: A:7<10, B:7>3, C:6<7. So only B win. Not enough.\n\nBut if Beta uses something like R4's [7,7,6], then [7,7,6] vs [7,7,6] would tie all, but unlikely.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if Alpha uses [8, 7, 5].\n\nAgainst Beta R5 [10,3,7]: A:8<10, B:7>3, C:5<7 → only B.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternative idea inspired by R2 win: Alpha used [10,4,6] when Beta did [9,9,2]. So high A, medium C, low B.\n\nIf Beta is now using high A and medium C, maybe Alpha can go high B and C.\n\nWait, Round 3 Alpha tried [4,10,6] which lost because Beta had [7,6,7]. So B was won by Alpha (10>6), but lost A and C.\n\nIf Alpha does [3,11,6], sum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta R5 [10,3,7]: A:3<10, B:11>3, C:6<7 → only B.\n\nStill no.\n\nWait, need two fields. So either:\n\n- Win A and B: need A > Beta's A, B > Beta's B\n\n- Win A and C\n\n- Win B and C\n\nGiven that Beta's recent A has been high (10 in R5), maybe focus on B and C.\n\nAssume Beta might keep A high, say 9-10.\n\nSo to win B and C, Alpha needs B and C allocations higher than Beta's.\n\nIf Beta's B has been low (3 in R5), but might increase if they think Alpha is targeting B.\n\nBut if Alpha puts, say, B=8 and C=8, then A=4.\n\n[A4 B8 C8]\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta R5 [10,3,7]: A lose, B win (8>3), C win (8>7). So two wins. Perfect.\n\nBut will Beta have similar allocations?\n\nIf Beta anticipates this, they might up B and C.\n\nBut given Beta's history, in R5 C was 7. If Beta keeps C around 7, then C=8 would win.\n\nAlso, B=8 would beat previous low Bs.\n\nBut what if Beta increases B?\n\nFor example, if Beta does [9,5,6], then:\n\nA:4<9, B:8>5, C:8>6 → two wins.\n\nIf Beta does [8,6,6], same result.\n\nIf Beta does [10,4,6], then:\n\nA:4<10, B:8>4, C:8>6 → two wins.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nAnother check: against Beta's R4 move [7,7,6], Alpha's [4,8,8] would have:\n\nA:4<7, B:8>7, C:8>6 → two wins. Which would have won Round 4 (which Alpha did win, but with different allocation).\n\nIn Round 3, Beta's move was [7,6,7]. [4,8,8] vs that: A lose, B win (8>6), C win (8>7). Two wins, so Alpha would have won Round 3 as well.\n\nRound 2 Beta: [9,9,2]. [4,8,8] vs that: A lose, B lose (8<9), C win (8>2). Only one win. So wouldn't have worked there, but Round 2 Alpha used a different strategy.\n\nBut overall, [4,8,8] could be a good move now, especially since Beta's recent moves have lower B and C.\n\nWait, in R5 Beta's B=3, C=7. So B=8 and C=8 would beat both.\n\nAlso, sum is 4+8+8=20.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible issue: if Beta decides to go very high on one field, but given previous patterns, seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, [5,7,8] but sum 20. Let's see: similar idea.\n\nBut [4,8,8] seems clean.\n\nWait, but in the previous rounds, Alpha hasn't used this exact split. Let's confirm:\n\nR1:8,8,4\n\nR2:10,4,6\n\nR3:4,10,6\n\nR4:9,2,9\n\nR5:9,2,9\n\nSo [4,8,8] is a new pattern, permuting R1's numbers.\n\nThis might catch Beta off guard, especially since Beta saw Alpha using low B recently.\n\nYes, I think [A4 B8 C8] could be a solid choice for Round 6.\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best allocation for Round 6 of Colonel Blotto. So far, the game has gone through 5 rounds, and the score is tied 2-2. Each round, we have to allocate exactly 20 troops across three battlefields: A, B, and C. The goal is to win two out of the three fields to win the round.\n\nFirst, I should look at the previous rounds to see if there's a pattern in how Commander Alpha is playing. Let's recap the allocations:\n\nRound 1:\n- Alpha: A8 B8 C4\n- Beta: A8 B8 C4 → Tie\n\nRound 2:\n- Alpha: A10 B4 C6\n- Beta: A9 B9 C2 → Alpha won (A10 > A9, B4 < B9, C6 > C2 → Alpha wins A and C)\n\nRound 3:\n- Alpha: A4 B10 C6\n- Beta: A7 B6 C7 → Beta won (A7 > A4, B6 < B10, C7 > C6 → Beta wins A and C)\n\nRound 4:\n- Alpha: A9 B2 C9\n- Beta: A7 B7 C6 → Alpha won (A9 > A7, B2 < B7, C9 > C6 → Alpha wins A and C)\n\nRound 5:\n- Alpha: A9 B2 C9\n- Beta: A10 B3 C7 → Beta won (A10 > A9, B3 > B2, C7 < C9 → Beta wins A and B)\n\nHmm, in rounds 4 and 5, Alpha used the same allocation: A9 B2 C9. That's interesting. So maybe Alpha is sticking to a strategy of putting high on A and C, low on B. In Round 4, Beta lost because even though Beta had more on B (7 vs 2), Alpha had more on A and C. But in Round 5, Beta adjusted by putting 10 on A (beating Alpha's 9), 3 on B (beating Alpha's 2), and 7 on C (losing to Alpha's 9). So Beta won A and B.\n\nWait, so for Round 6, if Alpha is likely to repeat A9 B2 C9 again (since they did it twice in a row), then Beta should counter that. But maybe Alpha will change tactics after Round 5 where their strategy failed. Let's think.\n\nIn Round 5, Beta's allocation was A10 B3 C7. That worked because A10 > 9, B3 > 2, C7 < 9. So two wins. If Alpha anticipates that Beta might do something similar again, maybe Alpha will adjust. But since we don't know for sure, we have to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at Alpha's previous allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4 (balanced except C lower)\nRound 2: A10 B4 C6 (high A, medium C, low B)\nRound 3: A4 B10 C6 (low A, high B, medium C)\nRound 4 and 5: A9 B2 C9 (high A and C, very low B)\n\nSo Alpha seems to be varying their strategy, but in the last two rounds, they went for high A and C, low B. Maybe they'll continue that, or maybe switch after Beta countered it in Round 5.\n\nIf Alpha sticks with A9 B2 C9 again, then Beta needs to beat that. To win two fields, Beta needs to have higher than 9 on two fields, but since total is 20, that's not possible (9+9=18, leaving 2, but 9+9+2=20. Wait, but to beat 9 on two fields, Beta would need at least 10 on two fields, which would be 10+10=20, leaving 0 for the third. So A10 B10 C0. Then against Alpha's A9 B2 C9: Beta wins A (10>9) and B (10>2), loses C (0<9). So that would work.\n\nBut maybe Alpha will change. For example, in Round 3, Alpha had B10, so maybe they'll go high on B again. Alternatively, maybe they'll mirror Beta's previous move.\n\nWait, Beta's last move was A10 B3 C7. If Alpha thinks Beta will do something similar, maybe Alpha will adjust. But it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider common strategies in Blotto. A common approach is to allocate based on the sum. Since you need to win two fields, you might want to have two fields with higher than average. But the average per field is 20/3 ≈6.66. So maybe putting around 7 on two fields.\n\nBut looking at Alpha's recent moves, they've been doing 9,9,2. So perhaps Beta can target the low field. In Alpha's last two rounds, B was 2. So if Beta puts, say, 3 on B, that would beat Alpha's 2. Then they need to win one more field. If Alpha has 9 on A and C, Beta needs to have more than 9 on one of them. But 10 on A, 3 on B, and 7 on C (as in Round 5) works if Alpha does 9,2,9.\n\nBut if Alpha changes, say, increases B to 6, then Beta's 3 on B would lose. So maybe a safer bet is to spread out more.\n\nWait, another angle: in Blotto, sometimes players use a strategy of splitting into 7-7-6 or similar. Let's see previous Beta allocations:\n\nRound 1: 8,8,4\nRound 2:9,9,2\nRound3:7,6,7\nRound4:7,7,6\nRound5:10,3,7\n\nSo Beta has varied. In Round 5, they did 10,3,7 to counter Alpha's 9,2,9.\n\nFor Round 6, if Beta assumes Alpha might repeat 9,2,9, then 10,3,7 works. But maybe Alpha will switch. For example, if Alpha anticipates Beta will do high A and B, maybe Alpha will put more on B.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Round 3: Alpha did 4,10,6. So maybe they might go high on B again.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in Round 4 and 5, Alpha used 9,2,9, and Beta beat it in Round 5 with 10,3,7. So Alpha might change. Maybe Alpha will put more on B next time. For instance, if Alpha puts 5 on B instead of 2, then Beta's 3 on B would lose. So Beta needs a more balanced approach.\n\nAnother thought: the most common allocations in Blotto for 20 troops might be around 7-7-6. Let's see what happens if Beta uses 7-7-6.\n\nAgainst Alpha's possible moves:\n\nIf Alpha does 9,2,9: Beta's 7,7,6 would have A7 <9, B7>2, C6<9 → only win B, so lose.\n\nBut if Alpha changes to something else, like 6,8,6: then Beta's 7,7,6 would win A and B.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta uses 8,8,4 (like Round 1), but that led to a tie when Alpha did the same.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to look for a Nash equilibrium or common strategies. In three-field Blotto with 20, typical strategies might involve splitting into three numbers that sum to 20, with two fields higher than the third.\n\nAlternatively, considering that to win two fields, Beta needs to have two fields where their allocation is higher than Alpha's. So ideally, Beta wants to have two fields with more than Alpha's, but since they don't know Alpha's move, they have to guess.\n\nGiven that in the last two rounds Alpha used 9,2,9, and Beta beat it with 10,3,7, Alpha might respond by increasing B. Suppose Alpha changes to 8,4,8 (sum 20). Then Beta's 10,3,7 would have A10>8, B3<4, C7<8 → only win A, which is bad. So Beta needs something that can handle possible Alpha adjustments.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta uses 9,4,7. Let's see:\n\nAgainst Alpha's 9,2,9: A9=9 (tie), B4>2, C7<9 → only win B, which isn't enough.\n\nHmm. Maybe 9,5,6. Against 9,2,9: A tie, B5>2, C6<9 → still only one win.\n\nWait, to win two fields against 9,2,9, Beta needs to have >9 on one field and >2 on another. So for example, A10, B3, C7: A10>9, B3>2, C7<9 → two wins. Or A3, B10, C7: B10>2, C7<9, A3<9 → only one win. So high A and B.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha changes to 7,6,7 (similar to Beta's Round3), then Beta's 10,3,7 would have A10>7, B3<6, C7=7 → tie C, so win A only.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe Beta should try to avoid the previous pattern. Let's see what worked before.\n\nIn Round3, Beta used 7,6,7 against Alpha's 4,10,6. Beta won A and C.\n\nRound5: 10,3,7 against 9,2,9. Won A and B.\n\nSo perhaps varying the high allocations.\n\nAnother approach: since the total is 20, the possible pairs for two fields could be (10,10,0), (11,9,0), etc. But (10,10,0) would win two fields if Alpha has less than 10 on two fields.\n\nBut if Alpha uses 9,2,9, then (10,10,0) would win A and B.\n\nWait, yes. A10 vs 9: win, B10 vs 2: win, C0 vs9: lose. So two wins. That would work. So why didn't Beta use that in Round5? Oh, in Round5, Beta used 10,3,7, which also worked. But 10,10,0 is another option.\n\nBut if Alpha anticipates that, they might put more on B. For example, if Alpha does 8,5,7. Then Beta's 10,10,0 would win A (10>8), lose B (10>5? Wait, 10>5 yes, so win B as well. Wait, no: if Alpha has B5, Beta's B10 would beat it. So 10,10,0 would win A and B against 8,5,7.\n\nWait, but maybe Alpha would do something like 0,10,10. Then Beta's 10,10,0 would tie A, lose B (10 vs10 tie?), wait no, in Blotto, if it's a tie on a field, neither wins it. So to win a field, you need strictly more.\n\nSo if Alpha does 0,10,10, and Beta does 10,10,0:\n\nA: 10 vs 0 → Beta wins\n\nB: 10 vs10 → tie\n\nC: 0 vs10 → Alpha wins\n\nSo Beta only wins one field (A), which is not enough. So 10,10,0 is risky if Alpha goes for high on two other fields.\n\nBut given that Alpha's recent moves have been high on A and C, low on B, 10,10,0 might be good. But perhaps safer to have a more balanced approach.\n\nWait, another idea. In Round4, Alpha used 9,2,9 and Beta used 7,7,6 which lost. Then in Round5, Beta adjusted to 10,3,7 and won. So if Alpha is likely to stick with 9,2,9, then 10,3,7 is good. But if Alpha changes, maybe to 8,4,8, then:\n\nBeta's 10,3,7 vs Alpha's 8,4,8:\n\nA:10>8, B:3<4, C:7<8 → only win A, which loses the round.\n\nSo Beta needs a strategy that's robust against possible Alpha changes.\n\nWhat if Beta uses 8,6,6? Let's check against possible Alpha moves.\n\nIf Alpha does 9,2,9:\n\nA:8<9, B:6>2, C:6<9 → only B, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf Alpha does 8,4,8:\n\nA:8=8 tie, B:6>4, C:6<8 → only B, lose.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat about 9,5,6.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A tie, B5>2, C6<9 → only B, lose.\n\nAgainst 8,4,8: A9>8, B5>4, C6<8 → win A and B, good.\n\nBut against 9,2,9 it's bad.\n\nAlternatively, 7,7,6.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A7<9, B7>2, C6<9 → only B, lose.\n\nAgainst 8,4,8: A7<8, B7>4, C6<8 → only B, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to have one very high, one medium, one low, such that it counters Alpha's likely low field.\n\nSince Alpha's last two had B as 2, maybe B is their low field. So Beta should put just enough on B to beat whatever Alpha puts there, say 3, and then distribute the rest to win one more field.\n\nIf Beta puts 3 on B, then they have 17 left for A and C.\n\nTo beat Alpha on A or C, assuming Alpha has 9 on A and C.\n\nSo if Beta puts 10 on A and 7 on C (total 10+3+7=20), as in Round5, which worked.\n\nAlternatively, 11 on A, 3 on B, 6 on C: 11>9, 3>2, 6<9 → win A and B.\n\nBut 11 might be overkill; 10 is enough.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta thinks Alpha might increase B to 3 or 4, then putting 4 or 5 on B.\n\nFor example, B4, then A and C get 16. If Alpha has 9 on A and C, Beta needs 10 on one of them. So A10 B4 C6. Total 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's 9,2,9: A10>9, B4>2, C6<9 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst Alpha changing to 8,4,8: A10>8, B4=4 tie, C6<8 → only A, which is bad.\n\nWait, if Alpha changes B to 4, then Beta's B4 ties, so no win there.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: look at the history of field wins.\n\nIn Round1: Tie on all.\n\nRound2: Alpha won A and C.\n\nRound3: Beta won A and C.\n\nRound4: Alpha won A and C.\n\nRound5: Beta won A and B.\n\nSo fields A and C have been more contested, with B sometimes being low.\n\nMaybe Beta should focus on B and one other field.\n\nWait, in Round5, Beta won by taking A and B. So perhaps if B is often low for Alpha, focusing there.\n\nGiven that in Rounds 4 and 5, Alpha put 2 on B, maybe they'll continue that, or maybe not.\n\nIf Beta assumes Alpha still has low B, say ≤3, then putting 4 on B would secure that field.\n\nThen with 16 left for A and C.\n\nTo win one of A or C, assuming Alpha has 9 on each.\n\nSo need ≥10 on one of them.\n\nSo A10 B4 C6.\n\nCheck sum: 10+4+6=20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's 9,2,9:\n\nA10>9, B4>2, C6<9 → win A and B → good.\n\nIf Alpha changes to A8 B4 C8:\n\nA10>8, B4=4 tie, C6<8 → only A, which is bad.\n\nBut if Alpha increases B to 4, then Beta's B4 ties, so no win there.\n\nAlternatively, A11 B3 C6.\n\nWait, sum is 20.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A11>9, B3>2, C6<9 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst 8,4,8: A11>8, B3<4, C6<8 → only A, lose.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, A9 B5 C6.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A tie, B5>2, C6<9 → only B, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if Beta uses A7 B8 C5.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A7<9, B8>2, C5<9 → only B.\n\nNope.\n\nWait, perhaps the safest is to go for two fields with 8 each and 4 on the third. Like 8,8,4.\n\nAgainst Alpha's 9,2,9: A8<9, B8>2, C4<9 → only B.\n\nLose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, what if Beta does 12, 3, 5.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A12>9, B3>2, C5<9 → win A and B.\n\nIf Alpha changes to 7,6,7: A12>7, B3<6, C5<7 → only A.\n\nLose.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: look for allocations that have worked for Beta in the past.\n\nRound3: Beta won with 7,6,7 against Alpha's 4,10,6. Beta won A and C.\n\nRound5: Beta won with 10,3,7 against 9,2,9. Won A and B.\n\nSo different strategies. Maybe varying is good.\n\nFor Round6, perhaps Beta should try to win B and C.\n\nAssuming Alpha might still have low B.\n\nSo put enough on B to win it (say 3 or more), and enough on C to win it.\n\nIf Alpha has A high, B low, C medium.\n\nWait, in Round2, Alpha had C6, Round3 C6, Round4 C9, Round5 C9.\n\nSo recently C has been high (9).\n\nSimilarly A has been high (9 or 10).\n\nSo likely Alpha will have high A and C, low B.\n\nThus, Beta needs to take B and one more.\n\nSo B needs ≥3 (since Alpha had 2 last two rounds), and either A or C.\n\nTo take A: need ≥10 (if Alpha has 9).\n\nTo take C: need ≥10 (if Alpha has 9).\n\nBut with B=3, then A+C=17.\n\nIf Beta puts 10 on A and 7 on C: total 20.\n\nAs in Round5.\n\nBut maybe Alpha will catch on and increase B.\n\nAlternatively, make it 9 on A, 4 on B, 7 on C.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's 9,2,9: A tie, B4>2, C7<9 → only B, lose.\n\nNo good.\n\nWait, need strictly more on two fields.\n\nSo to beat 9 on A, need 10.\n\nTo beat 2 on B, need 3.\n\nSo 10 on A, 3 on B, 7 on C.\n\nAs before.\n\nAlternatively, 3 on B, 7 on A, 10 on C.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A7<9, B3>2, C10>9 → win B and C.\n\nThat also works.\n\nSo either A or C high.\n\nWhich one is better?\n\nLooking at Alpha's allocations:\n\nRound4: A9 B2 C9\n\nRound5: A9 B2 C9\n\nSo symmetric on A and C.\n\nThus, it doesn't matter whether Beta chooses A or C to be high, as long as they pick one.\n\nBut if Beta varies, maybe.\n\nIn Round5, Beta was high on A (10), so maybe this time high on C.\n\nSo B3, A7, C10.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's 9,2,9:\n\nA7<9, B3>2, C10>9 → wins B and C → good.\n\nIf Alpha changes to increase B, say B4, then:\n\nA7<9, B3<4, C10>9 → only C, lose.\n\nBut if Alpha increases B beyond 3, then Beta loses B.\n\nBut given that in previous rounds when Alpha lost (Round5), they might try to reinforce B.\n\nSo maybe safer to put 4 on B.\n\nSo A6 B4 C10.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A6<9, B4>2, C10>9 → win B and C.\n\nAgainst if Alpha does A8 B4 C8: A6<8, B4=4 tie, C10>8 → win C only. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, A10 B4 C6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A10>9, B4>2, C6<9 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst A8 B4 C8: A10>8, B4=4 tie, C6<8 → win A only. Lose.\n\nBut if the probability that Alpha repeats 9,2,9 is higher than changing, then A10 B4 C6 is good.\n\nAlternatively, use a more balanced approach like A8 B5 C7.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A8<9, B5>2, C7<9 → only B.\n\nLose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, another thought. In Round3, when Alpha used B10, Beta won by having A7 and C7.\n\nSo if Alpha goes high on B again, Beta should have medium on A and C.\n\nBut it's hard to cover all possibilities.\n\nGiven the time, maybe the best bet is to assume Alpha repeats 9,2,9, so Beta should do 10,3,7 (as Round5) or 7,3,10.\n\nBut to vary, maybe do 7,3,10 this time.\n\nSo [A7 B3 C10]\n\nCheck sum:7+3+10=20.\n\nAgainst Alpha's 9,2,9:\n\nA:7<9, B:3>2, C:10>9 → wins B and C → two fields, win.\n\nIf Alpha changes to something else, like 8,4,8:\n\nA7<8, B3<4, C10>8 → only C, lose.\n\nBut if Alpha is likely to repeat, this works.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha changes B to 3, then B3 ties, so no win there.\n\nBut given the history, Alpha used B2 twice, so maybe still low.\n\nAnother option: A11 B3 C6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst 9,2,9: A11>9, B3>2, C6<9 → win A and B.\n\nIf Alpha does 10,0,10: A11>10, B3>0, C6<10 → win A and B.\n\nBut if Alpha does 0,10,10: A11>0, B3<10, C6<10 → only A, lose.\n\nBut it's less likely.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best move is to go with either A10 B3 C7 or A7 B3 C10.\n\nSince in Round5 Beta used A10 B3 C7, maybe Alpha will anticipate that and increase B to 4 or something. So switching to focus on C might be better.\n\nSo choosing [A7 B3 C10].\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I'm Commander Alpha in this Colonel Blotto game. We're in Round 7 now. The score is Alpha 2, Beta 3. So Beta is leading. I need to win this round to get back in the game.\n\nFirst, I should look at the previous rounds to see Beta's patterns. Let me recap what Beta has done so far.\n\nRound 1: Beta played A8 B8 C4. Same as me, tie.\nRound 2: Beta played A9 B9 C2. I did A10 B4 C6, so I won A and C (since 10>9, 6>2; B was 4<9 but I won two fields).\nRound 3: Beta A7 B6 C7. I did A4 B10 C6. So Beta won A and C (7>4, 7>6), I won B. Beta won.\nRound 4: Beta A7 B7 C6. I played A9 B2 C9. So I won A and C (9>7, 9>6), Beta won B. I won.\nRound 5: Beta A10 B3 C7. I played A9 B2 C9. Beta won A (10>9), I won C (9>7), B was 2<3. So Beta won two fields (A and B), hence Beta won the round.\nRound 6: Beta A7 B3 C10. I did A4 B8 C8. Beta won A (7>4) and C (10>8), I won B (8>3). So Beta won.\n\nHmm, Beta seems to vary their allocations. Let's see if there's a pattern. In Round 2, Beta had high on A and B, low on C. Round 3, balanced but slightly high on A and C. Round 4, balanced. Round 5, high on A, medium on C, low on B. Round 6, high on A and C, low on B.\n\nWait, in Round 5, Beta did A10 B3 C7. So A was maxed, B very low, C medium. In Round 6, A7 B3 C10. So A medium, B low, C high.\n\nSo Beta might be shifting the high allocation between fields. Maybe they are trying to counter what I did in the previous round.\n\nLooking at my previous plays:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4 (tie)\nRound 2: A10 B4 C6 (won)\nRound 3: A4 B10 C6 (lost)\nRound 4: A9 B2 C9 (won)\nRound 5: A9 B2 C9 (lost)\nRound 6: A4 B8 C8 (lost)\n\nSo in Round 4 and 5, I played the same strategy: A9 B2 C9. In Round 4, it worked because Beta had A7 B7 C6. But in Round 5, Beta adjusted to A10 B3 C7, which beat me.\n\nThen in Round 6, I switched to A4 B8 C8, but Beta did A7 B3 C10. So Beta put high on C, which beat my C8 with C10.\n\nNow, for Round 7. I need to anticipate Beta's move. What might Beta do next?\n\nIn Round 6, Beta used C10. Maybe they will shift focus again. Let's think about possible strategies.\n\nIn Colonel Blotto, a common tactic is to have two fields with higher numbers and one low, but since you need to win two, you have to outbid on two.\n\nBut Beta's recent moves:\n\nRound 4: Beta A7 B7 C6 (balanced, but C slightly lower)\nRound 5: A10 B3 C7 (A high, B low, C medium)\nRound 6: A7 B3 C10 (A medium, B low, C high)\n\nAh, noticing a pattern here. In Round 5, Beta put high on A, medium on C. Round 6, high on C, medium on A. So maybe Beta is alternating where they put the highest number. Round 5: A=10 (highest), Round 6: C=10 (highest). So perhaps Round 7, Beta might put highest on B?\n\nWait, in Round 5, A was 10 (highest), C was 7. Round 6, C was 10, A was 7. So maybe they are cycling the highest allocation between A and C. If that's the case, maybe next they go back to A? Or maybe to B?\n\nWait, in Round 2, Beta did A9 B9 C2 (so high on A and B), Round 3 A7 B6 C7 (balanced), Round 4 A7 B7 C6 (balanced), Round 5 A10 B3 C7 (A high), Round 6 A7 B3 C10 (C high). So from Round 5 to 6, they moved the high from A to C. So maybe Round 7, they move high to B?\n\nIf Beta is cycling the highest allocation: A (R5), C (R6), then B (R7). That could be possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta is reacting to my previous move. Let's see what I did in Round 6: A4 B8 C8. So I had low on A, high on B and C. Beta responded with A7 B3 C10. Which beat me on A and C. So Beta put more on A and C, which were the fields I had high on.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is trying to outbid me on the fields where I allocated more.\n\nIn Round 6, I did B8 and C8. Beta put C10 which beat my C8, and A7 which beat my A4. So Beta focused on A and C.\n\nNow, for Round 7, I need to think what would counter Beta's possible strategy.\n\nIf I assume Beta will again focus on two fields, but which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta is using a strategy of putting a lot on one field and medium on others.\n\nWait, looking at Beta's allocations:\n\nRound 2: A9 B9 C2 (two high, one low)\nRound 3: A7 B6 C7 (balanced)\nRound 4: A7 B7 C6 (balanced)\nRound 5: A10 B3 C7 (one very high, one low, one medium)\nRound 6: A7 B3 C10 (one high, one low, one medium)\n\nSo starting from Round 5, Beta is doing one high, one low, one medium. Specifically, in R5: A=10 (high), B=3 (low), C=7 (medium). R6: A=7 (medium), B=3 (low), C=10 (high). So the low is always B? In R5 and R6, B was 3. Wait, Round 2 Beta had B9, but that was earlier. From Round 5 and 6, Beta is putting low on B (3 each time). That's interesting.\n\nWait Round 5: B=3, Round 6: B=3. So maybe Beta is consistently putting low on B recently. If that's the case, then in Round 7, Beta might still put low on B.\n\nIf Beta's pattern is low on B (3), then high on either A or C, and medium on the other.\n\nIn Round 5: A=10 (high), C=7 (medium)\nRound 6: A=7 (medium), C=10 (high)\nSo alternating high between A and C.\n\nSo Round 7, Beta might do A=10, C=7 again? Or maybe they switch again. Wait, Round 5 high on A, Round 6 high on C. So Round 7, maybe high on A again? Or perhaps they go back to balanced?\n\nBut assuming they continue the pattern, if Round 5: A high, Round 6: C high, then Round 7: maybe A high again? Or perhaps B high?\n\nWait, but in both R5 and R6, B was low (3). So maybe Beta is keeping B low, and swapping high between A and C.\n\nIf that's the case, then in Round 7, Beta might put high on A again (like R5), or high on C again (like R6), or maybe they do something else.\n\nBut given that in R5 and R6 they alternated A and C as high, perhaps in R7 they go back to A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they do B high this time. But in R5 and R6, B was low, so maybe they stick with low B.\n\nAssuming Beta keeps B low (say 3 or 4), then they have 17 points left for A and C.\n\nIf they alternate, then Round 7 they might put high on A again (10), medium on C (7), B=3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they vary it a bit.\n\nBut as Commander Alpha, I need to choose an allocation that can win two fields.\n\nGiven that in the previous round (Round 6), I played A4 B8 C8, and Beta did A7 B3 C10. So Beta beat me on A and C.\n\nSo if Beta is likely to have low B again (B=3 or similar), then putting high on B might secure that field. But wait, in Round 6, I put B8 and won B (since Beta had B3), but I lost the round because Beta won A and C.\n\nSo the problem was that even though I won B, I lost A and C. So to win the round, I need to win two fields.\n\nSo perhaps I should focus on two fields where I can outbid Beta.\n\nAssuming Beta has low on B (say 3), then if I put, say, B=4, I can win B. Then I need to win one more field.\n\nBut Beta's allocation on A and C depends on their strategy.\n\nIf Beta is alternating high between A and C:\n\n- If Beta's Round 7 is like Round 5 (A=10, C=7), then I need to beat A or C.\n\nBut if I put high on C (say C=11), then C=11 >7, so I win C. And if I have B=4, win B. So total two wins.\n\nBut wait, total units must be 20. So if B=4, C=11, then A=5. But Beta's A=10, so A=5 <10, I lose A. But win B and C: total two, so win the round.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does Round 6 style (A=7, C=10), then I need to beat A and/or C.\n\nIf I have A=8, C=9, then A=8>7, C=9<10. So win A, lose C. If B is 3 (my B=4), win B. So two wins.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to choose an allocation that covers both possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, since Beta seems to have low B (3 in last two rounds), perhaps I can secure B with a moderate number, then focus on one other field.\n\nFor example, if I put B=4 (to beat Beta's likely B=3), then allocate the remaining 16 between A and C.\n\nIf Beta has high on A (10), then C=7. So if I put C=8, then C=8>7, so I win C and B. Total two.\n\nIf Beta has high on C (10), then A=7. So if I put A=8, then A=8>7, win A and B.\n\nSo if I do A=8, B=4, C=8. Wait, 8+4+8=20. Let's check:\n\nIf Beta does A10 B3 C7 (like R5), then:\n\nA: 8 <10 → lose\n\nB:4 >3 → win\n\nC:8 >7 → win\n\nTotal: win B and C → win round.\n\nIf Beta does A7 B3 C10 (like R6):\n\nA:8 >7 → win\n\nB:4 >3 → win\n\nC:8 <10 → lose\n\nTotal: win A and B → win round.\n\nOh, this seems good. So A8 B4 C8 would beat both of Beta's recent patterns.\n\nWait, but in this case, A8 B4 C8 sums to 20. Let me check:\n\n8 +4 +8 =20. Yes.\n\nBut wait, in Round 2, I played A10 B4 C6. But this is different.\n\nWait, but this allocation A8 B4 C8 would win against both R5 and R6 style of Beta.\n\nIn R5 scenario: Beta A10 B3 C7. My A8 <10 (lose A), B4>3 (win B), C8>7 (win C). So two wins.\n\nIn R6 scenario: Beta A7 B3 C10. My A8>7 (win A), B4>3 (win B), C8<10 (lose C). Two wins.\n\nPerfect. So this would counter both possibilities.\n\nBut wait, is there a chance Beta does something else? For example, if Beta decides to put high on B this time. But given that in the last two rounds Beta put B=3, it's less likely. But possible.\n\nIf Beta does, say, A5 B10 C5.\n\nThen my A8>5, B4<10, C8>5. So win A and C. Still two wins. So even if Beta puts high on B, I still win two fields.\n\nWait, that's even better. Because if Beta puts a lot on B, then A and C would be lower, so my A8 and C8 might beat them.\n\nFor example, Beta A5 B10 C5:\n\nA:8>5, B:4<10, C:8>5. Win A and C.\n\nAnother example, Beta A6 B8 C6:\n\nA:8>6, B:4<8, C:8>6. Win A and C.\n\nSo regardless of where Beta allocates, as long as they don't put more than 8 on both A and C, which would require at least 17 (8+9), but with B at least 1, total 18, but they have 20. Wait, if Beta puts A9 B2 C9. Then my A8 <9, C8 <9. So lose A and C, but win B (4>2). Only one win. So lose the round.\n\nAh, this is a problem. If Beta plays something like A9 B2 C9, which I actually played in Rounds 4 and 5.\n\nIn Round 4, I did A9 B2 C9 against Beta's A7 B7 C6, and won.\n\nIn Round 5, Beta did A10 B3 C7 against my A9 B2 C9, and Beta won.\n\nSo if Beta uses A9 B2 C9, then my A8 B4 C8 would result in:\n\nA:8 <9, B:4 >2, C:8 <9. So only win B. Lose the round.\n\nHmm, so this allocation is vulnerable if Beta plays a two-high-one-low strategy similar to what I played earlier.\n\nBut does Beta tend to copy my previous moves? In Round 1, we both played the same. But after that, not really.\n\nWait, in Round 4, I played A9 B2 C9, and Beta played A7 B7 C6. Then in Round 5, I played the same A9 B2 C9, and Beta adjusted to A10 B3 C7.\n\nSo Beta might be adapting to my previous move.\n\nIn Round 6, I played A4 B8 C8, and Beta played A7 B3 C10.\n\nSo if I play A8 B4 C8 in Round 7, what might Beta do?\n\nIf Beta is adaptive, they might try to counter A8 B4 C8.\n\nTo beat A8 B4 C8, Beta would need to win two fields.\n\nSo they need to have more than 8 on two fields, but with total 20.\n\nFor example, A9 B9 C2: total 20. Then A9>8, B9>4, so win A and B.\n\nBut Beta might not do that. Alternatively, A9 B5 C6: A9>8, C6<8, B5>4. So win A and B.\n\nWait, but if Beta does A9 B5 C6, sum is 20. Then against my A8 B4 C8: A9>8, B5>4, so Beta wins A and B. I win C. So Beta wins the round.\n\nBut is this likely? It depends on Beta's strategy.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do A7 B10 C3: then B10>4, C3<8, A7<8. So I win A and C, Beta wins B. I win the round.\n\nHmm. So the vulnerability of A8 B4 C8 is if Beta puts high on A and B.\n\nBut given Beta's recent pattern of low B, perhaps they won't put high on B.\n\nWait, in the last two rounds, Beta had B=3. So if they continue low B, then A8 B4 C8 is safe.\n\nBut if Beta changes strategy, it could be bad.\n\nAlternative approach: given that Beta has been keeping B low (3 in R5 and R6), maybe I can secure B with B=4, and then split the rest to cover A and C.\n\nBut to ensure winning two fields, perhaps making A and C both 8 as above.\n\nAlternatively, another allocation. Let's think.\n\nSuppose I do A7 B6 C7. Total 20. Balanced.\n\nAgainst Beta's R5 (A10 B3 C7): A7<10, B6>3, C7=7 (tie?). Wait, in Blotto, is a tie on a field a loss for both? Or does it need to be strictly greater?\n\nThe problem statement says: \"Win two battlefields per round.\" And in Round 1, both played 8,8,4 and it was a tie. So likely, a tie on a battlefield means neither wins it. So to win a field, you need strictly more.\n\nSo in the case of A7 vs A7, it's a tie, no one wins the field.\n\nSo in my hypothetical A7 B6 C7 against Beta's R5 (A10 B3 C7):\n\nA:7<10 → Beta wins A\n\nB:6>3 → I win B\n\nC:7=7 → tie\n\nSo only one win (B), so I lose the round.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother idea: focus on two fields with higher numbers.\n\nSuppose I do A9 B2 C9 as before. But in Round 5, Beta beat that with A10 B3 C7.\n\nIf Beta is expecting me to repeat, they might counter again.\n\nAlternatively, do A5 B10 C5. Then against Beta's low B=3, I win B. If Beta has high on A and C, say A10 C7, then A5<10, C5<7. So only win B. Not good.\n\nWait, need to win two.\n\nWhat if I do A3 B14 C3. Then B is secured. But if Beta has B=3, then B14>3. Then need one more. If Beta has say A10 C7, then A3<10, C3<7. So only win B. Not enough.\n\nSo the key is to secure B (with B=4 or more, assuming Beta has B=3) and then have one of A or C sufficiently high.\n\nWait, but to win two, I need to win B and either A or C.\n\nSo if I allocate B=4, then 16 left for A and C.\n\nIf I make A=9, C=7. Then:\n\nAgainst Beta R5 (A10 B3 C7):\n\nA9 <10, C7=7 (tie), B4>3. So only B win. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf A=10, C=6:\n\nAgainst R5: A10=10 (tie?), C6<7. So no wins except B. Wait, tie on A means no one wins A. So only B win.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, need A or C to be higher than Beta's.\n\nAssuming Beta's A and C are either (10 and7) or (7 and10).\n\nSo to beat both scenarios, I need A >7 and C >7. Because:\n\nIf Beta's A=10, C=7: need C >7 to win C.\n\nIf Beta's A=7, C=10: need A >7 to win A.\n\nSo if I set A=8, C=8, then:\n\nIn first case: C=8>7, win C and B.\n\nIn second case: A=8>7, win A and B.\n\nYes, which is why A8 B4 C8 works.\n\nBut the problem is if Beta does something like A9 B2 C9.\n\nThen A8 <9, C8 <9, so only win B. Lose.\n\nBut how likely is Beta to play that?\n\nLooking at Beta's history:\n\nThey haven't played two high and one low since Round 2 (A9 B9 C2). After that, they did more balanced or one high.\n\nRound 3: balanced\n\nRound 4: balanced\n\nRound 5: one high (A)\n\nRound 6: one high (C)\n\nSo maybe Beta is now favoring one high, one medium, one low.\n\nIf that's the case, then A8 B4 C8 is a good counter.\n\nAlternatively, to protect against Beta possibly returning to two high, perhaps adjust slightly.\n\nFor example, A8 B3 C9. But B=3, if Beta also has B=3, tie. Not good.\n\nWait, need B to be at least 4 to beat Beta's likely B=3.\n\nSo B=4 is safe.\n\nAnother option: A7 B4 C9.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst R5 (A10 B3 C7):\n\nA7 <10, B4>3, C9>7 → win B and C.\n\nAgainst R6 (A7 B3 C10):\n\nA7=7 (tie), B4>3, C9 <10 → win only B. Tie on A, so only one win. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nSo A7 B4 C9 fails if Beta plays R6 style.\n\nWhereas A8 B4 C8:\n\nAgainst R6: A8>7, so win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAnother test: if Beta does A8 B3 C9.\n\nMy A8 vs A8: tie. B4>3. C8 <9. So only win B. Lose.\n\nBut is Beta likely to do that?\n\nNot sure. But given their recent pattern, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, A9 B4 C7.\n\nAgainst R5 (A10 B3 C7):\n\nA9 <10, C7=7, B4>3 → only B win.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst R6 (A7 B3 C10):\n\nA9>7, B4>3, C7 <10 → win A and B.\n\nSo only wins if Beta does R6 style, but loses if R5 style.\n\nNot as good as A8 B4 C8 which wins both.\n\nThus, A8 B4 C8 seems the best bet.\n\nWait, but in Round 2, I played A10 B4 C6. Which is somewhat similar but higher on A.\n\nBut considering all this, I think [A8 B4 C8] is a solid choice for Round 7.\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best allocation for Round 7 of Colonel Blotto. So far, the score is Commander Alpha has 2 wins, Commander Beta (me) has 3 wins. We're on round 7 out of 9.\n\nFirst, I should look at the previous rounds to see if there's a pattern in Alpha's allocations. Let's recap:\n\nRound 1: Alpha did [8,8,4], I did [8,8,4] → Tie\nRound 2: Alpha did [10,4,6], I did [9,9,2] → Alpha won (A:10>9, B:4<9, C:6>2 → Alpha wins A and C)\nRound 3: Alpha [4,10,6], I [7,6,7] → I won (A:7>4, B:6<10, C:7>6 → I win A and C)\nRound 4: Alpha [9,2,9], I [7,7,6] → Alpha won (A:9>7, B:2<7, C:9>6 → Alpha wins A and C)\nRound 5: Alpha [9,2,9], I [10,3,7] → I won (A:10>9, B:3>2, C:7<9 → I win A and B)\nRound 6: Alpha [4,8,8], I [7,3,10] → I won (A:7>4, B:3<8, C:10>8 → I win A and C)\n\nHmm, so Alpha's strategies have varied. In rounds 2,4,5 they used high numbers on A and C. Round 2 was [10,4,6], rounds 4 and 5 were [9,2,9]. Round 6 they switched to [4,8,8]. So maybe they're trying to spread out or focus on two fields.\n\nIn Round 5, when Alpha did [9,2,9], I countered with [10,3,7] which worked because I took A and B. Round 6, Alpha did [4,8,8], I did [7,3,10] taking A and C.\n\nNow, for Round 7. I need to predict what Alpha might do. Let's see the pattern. After Round 5 where I beat their [9,2,9] with [10,3,7], they might adjust. In Round 6, they went to [4,8,8]. Maybe they're trying to avoid the low B field? Or maybe they're mixing it up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they're using a strategy where they focus on two fields with high numbers. For example, in Rounds 2,4,5 they had two fields with 9 or 10, and one lower. Round 6 was two 8s and a 4.\n\nI should consider possible allocations Alpha might use. Common strategies in Blotto include splitting evenly, or focusing on two fields. Since they've used [9,2,9] twice (rounds 4 and 5), maybe they'll try something different now. Round 6 was [4,8,8], so perhaps they're varying.\n\nI need to choose an allocation that can win two fields against likely Alpha moves. Let's think about possible counter-strategies.\n\nIf Alpha uses a similar approach to Round 6 ([4,8,8]), then to beat that I need to have more than 4 on A, more than 8 on either B or C. But if I put high on A and C, like [5, x, 15-x], but wait total is 20. Wait, in Round 6, I used [7,3,10] which beat [4,8,8] because 7>4 (A), 3<8 (B), 10>8 (C). So two wins.\n\nIf Alpha does something like [5,7,8], then I need to cover two fields. Alternatively, maybe Alpha will go back to high on A and C.\n\nAnother angle: in previous rounds where Alpha used high on A and C (rounds 4,5: [9,2,9]), I countered in round 5 with [10,3,7], which took A and B. So if they do [9,2,9] again, [10,4,6] might work? Wait, but in round 2, when they did [10,4,6], I did [9,9,2] and lost because they had A and C. Wait, no: round 2 Alpha was [10,4,6], I was [9,9,2]. So A: 10>9 (Alpha), B:4<9 (me), C:6>2 (Alpha). So Alpha wins A and C.\n\nSo if Alpha uses [x, y, z] where x and z are high, I need to either take A and B, or B and C, or A and C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a balanced approach. But given that in round 3, when Alpha did [4,10,6], I did [7,6,7] and won A and C.\n\nHmm. Let's see the history of my allocations:\n\nRound 1: [8,8,4]\nRound 2: [9,9,2]\nRound 3: [7,6,7]\nRound 4: [7,7,6]\nRound 5: [10,3,7]\nRound 6: [7,3,10]\n\nSo I've been varying, sometimes high on A and B, sometimes A and C, etc.\n\nFor Round 7, considering Alpha's last move was [4,8,8] in round 6, which I beat with [7,3,10]. Maybe Alpha will adjust to put more on A, since they lost round 6 because they had only 4 on A. So perhaps in round 7, Alpha might increase A to counter my high A in round 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll go back to their previous pattern of high A and C.\n\nSuppose Alpha does [7, y, z] where y + z =13. Or maybe they do [8, something, something].\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that Alpha might try to win B and C again, as in round 2 where they had high A and C. Wait, no, in round 2 they had high A and C. In round 4 and 5, also high A and C.\n\nWait, rounds 2,4,5: Alpha used high on A and C. Rounds 3 and 6: different patterns.\n\nRound 3: Alpha did [4,10,6] (high B), which I countered with [7,6,7] (won A and C).\n\nRound 6: Alpha [4,8,8] (high B and C), I did [7,3,10] (won A and C).\n\nSo perhaps Alpha's common strategy is to sometimes focus on two fields, varying which ones. To counter, I need to cover two fields.\n\nGiven that in the last round (6), Alpha used [4,8,8], which is low on A, high on B and C. I beat it by going high on A and C.\n\nIf Alpha realizes that, maybe they'll increase A in round 7. Suppose they go for [7,7,6] or something. Wait, but I need to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use a mixed strategy. Since the game is about outguessing, maybe a good approach is to allocate in a way that covers possible common strategies.\n\nA common tactic is to put 7,7,6 or similar. But let's think.\n\nAnother approach: since winning two fields is the goal, the optimal strategy often involves splitting the 20 into three numbers where two are high enough to win against likely allocations.\n\nWait, but since both players are adapting, it's a bit of a cat and mouse.\n\nLooking at my previous winning allocations:\n\nRound 3: [7,6,7] beat [4,10,6] (I won A and C)\nRound 5: [10,3,7] beat [9,2,9] (I won A and B)\nRound 6: [7,3,10] beat [4,8,8] (I won A and C)\n\nSo in rounds 5 and 6, I won by taking A plus another field.\n\nIn round 3, same.\n\nSo perhaps a strategy of securing A and one other field.\n\nBut Alpha might catch on. In round 6, they had low A, so I took A. If they up A in round 7, I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, maybe go for B and C.\n\nWait, let's consider possible Alpha allocations:\n\nIf Alpha thinks I will go high on A again (like round 6's 7), they might put more on A. Suppose they do 8 on A, then maybe 6 and 6 on B and C.\n\nOr if they expect me to do like round 5 where I had 10 on A, they might put 11 on A, but since max per field is 20, but realistically, since total is 20, putting 11 on A would leave 9 for B and C.\n\nWait, but in previous rounds, Alpha's highest on a single field was 10 (round 2).\n\nAlternatively, they might try a balanced 7,7,6.\n\nAlternatively, mirror my previous move. In round 6, I did [7,3,10]. Maybe they'll do something like [8,4,8] to counter.\n\nWait, but it's hard to say. Maybe the best bet is to choose an allocation that can win against common possibilities.\n\nLet's think of possible allocations:\n\nIf I put 8 on A, 8 on B, 4 on C. But in round 1, that tied. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, 9 on A, 9 on B, 2 on C. But in round 2, that lost when Alpha did 10,4,6.\n\nAlternatively, spread as 6,7,7. Wait, but total 20.\n\nWait, 6+7+7=20. So [6,7,7].\n\nIf Alpha did something like [9,2,9], then [6,7,7] would lose A (6<9), win B (7>2), lose C (7<9). So only B, so lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf Alpha does [4,8,8], then [6,7,7]: A:6>4, B:7<8, C:7<8 → only A, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm. So 6,7,7 may not be good.\n\nWhat if I do [8,5,7]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:8<9, B:5>2, C:7<9 → only B, lose.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:8>4, B:5<8, C:7<8 → only A, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, need two wins.\n\nSuppose I do [9,4,7].\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:9=9 (tie?), but in Blotto usually ties go to no one, so need to have more. So 9 vs 9 is tie, so no win. So B:4>2 (win), C:7<9. So only B, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat if [10,4,6].\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:10>9, B:4>2, C:6<9. So win A and B → good.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:10>4, B:4<8, C:6<8 → only A, lose.\n\nBut if Alpha is using [4,8,8] again, this would lose. But if they switched back to [9,2,9], this would win.\n\nIn round 5, I used [10,3,7] against [9,2,9], which worked. So [10,4,6] is similar.\n\nBut what if Alpha anticipates that and uses something else.\n\nAlternatively, if I do [7, 10, 3]. Wait, total 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:7>4, B:10>8, C:3<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:7<9, B:10>2, C:3<9 → only B, lose.\n\nSo depends on what Alpha does.\n\nAlternatively, [5, 10, 5]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:5>4, B:10>8, C:5<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:5<9, B:10>2, C:5<9 → only B, lose.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, [8, 10, 2]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:8>4, B:10>8, C:2<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:8<9, B:10>2, C:2<9 → only B, lose.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSo if Alpha uses [9,2,9], I need to have >9 on A and >2 on B, but also not lose C. Wait, but 10+3+7=20.\n\nWait, in round 5, [10,3,7] vs [9,2,9]: A 10>9, B 3>2, C 7<9. So two wins.\n\nSo if Alpha repeats [9,2,9], [10,4,6] would also work: A 10>9, B 4>2, C 6<9. Two wins.\n\nBut if they change, say to [5,7,8], then [10,4,6]: A 10>5, B 4<7, C 6<8 → only A, lose.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha will do something like [7,7,6].\n\nIf I use [8,8,4], but that tied in round 1.\n\nWait, [9,7,4]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst [7,7,6]: A:9>7, B:7=7 (tie), C:4<6 → only A, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, [7,8,5].\n\nAgainst [7,7,6]: A:7=7, B:8>7, C:5<6 → only B, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm. Maybe a safer approach is to go for two fields with 8 each, but 8+8+4=20. But as seen in round 1, if Alpha does same, it's a tie.\n\nBut if I do [8,7,5], total 20.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:8<9, B:7>2, C:5<9 → only B.\n\nNo good.\n\nWait, what if I do [6, 8, 6]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:6<9, B:8>2, C:6<9 → only B.\n\nLose.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think about what Alpha might do based on their history.\n\nAlpha's allocations:\n\nRound 1: [8,8,4]\n\nRound 2: [10,4,6]\n\nRound 3: [4,10,6]\n\nRound 4: [9,2,9]\n\nRound 5: [9,2,9]\n\nRound 6: [4,8,8]\n\nSo they've used:\n\n- Two high (8,8,4), (10,4,6), (9,2,9), (4,8,8)\n\n- One high on B: (4,10,6)\n\nSo maybe they're varying between focusing on different pairs.\n\nIn rounds 4 and 5, they used [9,2,9] twice. Then in round 6, switched to [4,8,8].\n\nPerhaps for round 7, they might go back to a high B strategy, like [4,10,6] again? Or maybe [3,11,6], but 11 is high.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll do [5,5,10], focusing on C.\n\nBut hard to say.\n\nGiven that in round 6, they lost because they had low A (4), maybe they'll increase A.\n\nSuppose they do [7, x, y], with x + y =13.\n\nIf I assume they might do something like [7,6,7], similar to my round 3 allocation.\n\nIf I choose [8,5,7], then against [7,6,7]: A:8>7, B:5<6, C:7=7 → win A, tie C. So only one win. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, [9,5,6].\n\nAgainst [7,6,7]: A:9>7, B:5<6, C:6<7 → only A.\n\nLose.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if I go high on B and C.\n\nSay [4, 10, 6].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8] (round 6): A:4=4 (tie), B:10>8, C:6<8 → only B, lose.\n\nBut against [9,2,9]: A:4<9, B:10>2, C:6<9 → only B, lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, but in round 3, Alpha did [4,10,6], and I won with [7,6,7]. So if they do [4,10,6] again, [7,6,7] would work: A:7>4, B:6<10, C:7>6 → two wins.\n\nBut will they do that again? Maybe not, since it's been a few rounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll do [5,9,6].\n\nIf I use [7,7,6], total 20.\n\nAgainst [5,9,6]: A:7>5, B:7<9, C:6=6 → win A, tie C. Only one win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best bet is to anticipate a repeat of their recent move. Last move was [4,8,8]. If they do something similar, like [5,7,8], then to beat it I need >5 on A, and >7 on either B or C, and >8 on the other? Wait, no, just two fields.\n\nWait, to beat [5,7,8], I need two fields where my number is higher. So if I have A:6, B:8, C:6. Then A:6>5, B:8>7, C:6<8. So two wins.\n\nTotal is 6+8+6=20. So [6,8,6].\n\nLet's test:\n\nAgainst [5,7,8]: A:6>5, B:8>7, C:6<8 → win A and B. Good.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:6<9, B:8>2, C:6<9 → only B. Lose.\n\nBut if Alpha is likely switching from [4,8,8] to something else, maybe this could work.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha does [6,7,7], then [6,8,6] would have A:6=6, B:8>7, C:6<7 → only B. Lose.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother angle: since in the last round I used [7,3,10], which was high on A and C. Maybe Alpha will respond by increasing B and C, or A.\n\nIf they think I'll go high on A again, they might put more on A.\n\nSuppose they do [8, something, something].\n\nIf I do [9, something, something], but need two fields.\n\nAlternatively, use [7, 9, 4]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:7>4, B:9>8, C:4<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:7<9, B:9>2, C:4<9 → only B.\n\nSo if they repeat [4,8,8], this works. If they go back to [9,2,9], it doesn't.\n\nBut what's more likely? After losing round 6 with [4,8,8], they might adjust. Maybe increase A.\n\nSuppose they do [6,7,7].\n\n[7,9,4] would have A:7>6, B:9>7, C:4<7 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:7<9, B:9>2, C:4<9 → only B.\n\nStill only one win.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, [8, 7, 5].\n\nAgainst [6,7,7]: A:8>6, B:7=7, C:5<7 → only A.\n\nLose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, what if I do [5, 10, 5].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:5>4, B:10>8, C:5<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst [6,7,7]: A:5<6, B:10>7, C:5<7 → only B.\n\nLose.\n\nBut if Alpha does [7,6,7], then [5,10,5] would have A:5<7, B:10>6, C:5<7 → only B.\n\nStill one.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if I do [9, 8, 3].\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:9>4, B:8=8 (tie), C:3<8 → only A.\n\nLose.\n\nNot good.\n\n[10, 7, 3].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:10>4, B:7<8, C:3<8 → only A.\n\nLose.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, maybe go for B and C.\n\n[3, 10, 7].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:3<4, B:10>8, C:7<8 → only B.\n\nLose.\n\n[2, 10, 8].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:2<4, B:10>8, C:8=8 → only B.\n\nStill lose.\n\n[1, 10, 9].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:1<4, B:10>8, C:9>8 → win B and C. That works.\n\nTotal is 1+10+9=20.\n\nSo [A1 B10 C9].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:1 <4 (lose), B:10>8 (win), C:9>8 (win) → two wins.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:1<9, B:10>2, C:9=9 (tie) → only B, lose.\n\nBut if Alpha uses [9,2,9], this allocation loses. However, if they're using something like [4,8,8] again or similar, this works.\n\nWhat if Alpha does [5,7,8]:\n\n[A1 B10 C9] vs [5,7,8]: A:1<5, B:10>7, C:9>8 → win B and C. Good.\n\nAgainst [7,7,6]: A:1<7, B:10>7, C:9>6 → win B and C. Good.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: lose, but if Alpha is moving away from that pattern, maybe this is safer.\n\nIn round 6, they used [4,8,8], so if they continue with high B and C, this [1,10,9] would work.\n\nBut what if they go back to high A and C. Like [8,3,9].\n\n[A1 B10 C9] vs [8,3,9]: A:1<8, B:10>3, C:9=9 → only B. Lose.\n\nHmm. Risky.\n\nAlternatively, [2,9,9].\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:2<4, B:9>8, C:9>8 → win B and C.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:2<9, B:9>2, C:9=9 → only B. Lose.\n\nAgainst [5,7,8]: B and C win.\n\nAgainst [7,6,7]: B:9>6, C:9>7 → win B and C.\n\nThis seems better. [A2 B9 C9].\n\nWait, 2+9+9=20. Yes.\n\nLet's check:\n\nAgainst [4,8,8] (round 6 style): A:2<4, B:9>8, C:9>8 → two wins.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:2<9, B:9>2, C:9=9 → only B. So one win, lose.\n\nAgainst [5,7,8]: B:9>7, C:9>8 → two wins.\n\nAgainst [7,7,6]: B:9>7, C:9>6 → two wins.\n\nAgainst [8,8,4]: A:2<8, B:9>8, C:9>4 → two wins.\n\nWait, [8,8,4] was round 1. If Alpha uses that again, [2,9,9] would win B and C.\n\nSo this allocation [2,9,9] seems strong against most of Alpha's previous moves except when they do high A and low B (like [9,2,9]).\n\nBut in the case of [9,2,9], [2,9,9] only gets B. But if Alpha repeats [9,2,9], then they win A and C (9 vs 2 and 9 vs9), so tie on C? Wait:\n\n[2,9,9] vs [9,2,9]:\n\nA: 2 <9 → Alpha\n\nB:9 >2 → Beta\n\nC:9 =9 → tie\n\nSo Beta wins B, Alpha wins A, C is tie. So only one win for Beta → lose.\n\nBut if C is a tie, then no one gets it, so to win the round you need to win two fields. So if only one field is won, you lose.\n\nSo [2,9,9] would lose against [9,2,9].\n\nHowever, considering that Alpha used [9,2,9] in rounds 4 and 5, then switched to [4,8,8] in round 6, maybe they won't do [9,2,9] again. Maybe they're switching strategies.\n\nIf I assume that Alpha is likely to continue with something like [4,8,8] or similar high B and C, then [2,9,9] is good.\n\nAlternatively, what if they do [3,8,9].\n\n[2,9,9] vs [3,8,9]: A:2<3, B:9>8, C:9=9 → only B. Lose.\n\nAh, problem. If they have 9 on C, then C is tie.\n\nSo if they do [x, y, 9 or higher on C], this could be bad.\n\nWait, but total units are 20, so if they put 9 on C, then A+B=11.\n\nIf they do [3,8,9], then [2,9,9] gets B.\n\nBut only one win.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: [3,8,9] sum to 20. If Alpha does that, I need to beat two fields.\n\nIf I choose [4,9,7].\n\nAgainst [3,8,9]: A:4>3, B:9>8, C:7<9 → win A and B.\n\nTotal 4+9+7=20.\n\nLet's test this allocation [4,9,7].\n\nAgainst Round 6's [4,8,8]: A:4=4 (tie), B:9>8, C:7<8 → only B. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, [5,9,6].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:5>4, B:9>8, C:6<8 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:5<9, B:9>2, C:6<9 → only B. Lose.\n\nAgainst [3,8,9]: A:5>3, B:9>8, C:6<9 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [7,7,6]: A:5<7, B:9>7, C:6=6 → only B. Lose.\n\nHmm. So [5,9,6] works against some but not others.\n\nAnother option: [6,8,6].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:6>4, B:8=8, C:6<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nNo good.\n\n[7,8,5].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:7>4, B:8=8, C:5<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nSame.\n\n[8,7,5].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:8>4, B:7<8, C:5<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, going back to [2,9,9], even though it loses to [9,2,9], it might be a good bet if Alpha has moved on from that strategy.\n\nGiven that in round 6 they used [4,8,8], which is low A, high B and C, and I beat it with high A and C. Maybe they'll respond by not going low on A, but instead balancing or focusing elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, they might go high on A again.\n\nSuppose they do [7,3,10], similar to my round 6 move.\n\nThen if I do [2,9,9], versus [7,3,10]:\n\nA:2<7, B:9>3, C:9<10 → only B. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, if I do [3,10,7].\n\nAgainst [7,3,10]: A:3<7, B:10>3, C:7<10 → only B. Lose.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what if I mirror the opponent's last move. Alpha's last allocation was [4,8,8]. If I do [8,4,8], but total 20.\n\nWait, 8+4+8=20. Yes.\n\n[A8 B4 C8].\n\nLet's see:\n\nAgainst [4,8,8] (last round): A:8>4, B:4<8, C:8=8 → win A only. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nBut against other allocations:\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:8<9, B:4>2, C:8<9 → only B. Lose.\n\nAgainst [10,4,6]: A:8<10, B:4=4, C:8>6 → only C. Lose.\n\nNot great.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative approach: use a strategy that has worked before. In round 5, [10,3,7] worked against [9,2,9]. In round 6, [7,3,10] worked against [4,8,8].\n\nSo varying the high field between A and C, keeping B low.\n\nFor round 7, maybe go high on B? Like [3, 14, 3]. But 14 is very high. Let's see:\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:3<4, B:14>8, C:3<8 → only B. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, [4, 12, 4]. Same issue.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, another past winning allocation was [7,6,7] in round 3 against [4,10,6].\n\n[7,6,7] total 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:7>4, B:6<8, C:7<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:7<9, B:6>2, C:7<9 → only B. Lose.\n\nNot good now.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet's think of what allocation would beat the last few Alpha moves.\n\nAlpha's last three moves:\n\nRound 4: [9,2,9] → I lost with [7,7,6]\n\nRound 5: [9,2,9] → I won with [10,3,7]\n\nRound 6: [4,8,8] → I won with [7,3,10]\n\nSo in response to their [9,2,9], I used high A and moderate B.\n\nFor their [4,8,8], I used high A and C.\n\nIf they alternate, maybe next is something else.\n\nPerhaps the safest is to use a balanced approach that can cover multiple scenarios.\n\nWait, what if I do [6, 7, 7].\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:6>4, B:7<8, C:7<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\n[7,7,6] same issue.\n\nWait, no.\n\nHow about [5, 7, 8].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:5>4, B:7<8, C:8=8 → win A only.\n\nLose.\n\nNot good.\n\nAh, I need two wins. So perhaps [8, 5, 7].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:8>4, B:5<8, C:7<8 → only A.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, unless I put high on two fields.\n\nLike [9, 9, 2], but that lost in round 2 to [10,4,6].\n\nIf Alpha does [5,7,8], then [9,9,2] would get A and B.\n\nBut if they do [9,2,9], then [9,9,2] gets B and tie A.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, another idea. The sum is 20. To win two fields, ideally have two fields where I have at least 7 or 8.\n\nBut it's a guessing game.\n\nWait, looking at all Alpha's allocations:\n\nRound 1: 8,8,4\n\nRound 2:10,4,6\n\nRound 3:4,10,6\n\nRound 4:9,2,9\n\nRound 5:9,2,9\n\nRound 6:4,8,8\n\nThe minimum they've placed on a field is 2 (rounds 4,5), then 4 in several.\n\nThe maximum on a single field is 10.\n\nCommon patterns: often 4 or lower on one field.\n\nIn rounds 2,4,5,6, they've had at least one field with ≤4.\n\nExcept round 3 had 4,10,6.\n\nSo perhaps Alpha often sacrifices one field.\n\nIf that's the case, I should focus on winning two fields by having sufficient on two, while sacrificing one.\n\nThe question is which one to sacrifice.\n\nIn round 6, they sacrificed A (4), so I put 7 on A and won it.\n\nIf they sacrifice a different field this time, say B, then I should have high on A and C.\n\nOr if they sacrifice C, high on A and B.\n\nBut without knowing which they'll sacrifice, it's hard.\n\nBut given their history:\n\n- Sacrificed C in round 2 (6? No, round 2 was [10,4,6], so B was 4.\n\nWait:\n\nRound 1: 8,8,4 → sacrificed C\n\nRound 2:10,4,6 → sacrificed B\n\nRound 3:4,10,6 → sacrificed A\n\nRound 4:9,2,9 → sacrificed B\n\nRound 5:9,2,9 → sacrificed B\n\nRound 6:4,8,8 → sacrificed A\n\nSo the sacrificed field (lowest number) has been:\n\nRound 1: C\n\nRound 2: B\n\nRound 3: A\n\nRound 4: B\n\nRound 5: B\n\nRound 6: A\n\nSo recently, rounds 4-6: sacrificed B, B, A.\n\nPossibly, they might sacrifice C this time.\n\nIf they sacrifice C, meaning low on C, then I should have high on A and B.\n\nFor example, if they do something like [7,7,6], but that's not sacrificing. Wait, sacrificing would be like [8,8,4] where C is 4.\n\nSo if they sacrifice C → low C, then I need high A and B.\n\nIf they sacrifice B → low B, need high A and C.\n\nIf they sacrifice A → low A, need high B and C.\n\nGiven the pattern of sacrificed fields: C, B, A, B, B, A.\n\nMaybe next is C or B.\n\nIf I assume they might sacrifice C (as it was first in the pattern), then allocate high on A and B.\n\nSo, for example, [9,9,2]. But as seen before, risky.\n\nWait, [10,8,2]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst a sacrificed C (say C=4), then A:10, B:8, C:2.\n\nIf Alpha has, say, [7,7,6] → not sacrificing.\n\nWait, better example: if Alpha sacrifices C with [9,9,2], then I do [10,8,2] → but that's tie on C.\n\nWait, not helpful.\n\nAssume Alpha sacrifices C → their C is low, say ≤3.\n\nSo if I put 7 on A, 7 on B, 6 on C.\n\nWait, but if their C is low, maybe I can put less on C.\n\nWait, if they have low C, then to win A and B I need to beat their A and B.\n\nSuppose they sacrifice C with [x,y,z] where z ≤3, so x+y ≥17.\n\nTo beat two fields, I need A >x and B > y.\n\nBut x and y could be high.\n\nFor example, if they do [9,8,3], then I need >9 and >8 on two fields. But with 20 units, hard to do 10 and 9, which is 19, leaving 1 for C.\n\n[A10 B9 C1]. Total 20.\n\nAgainst [9,8,3]: A:10>9, B:9>8, C:1<3 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8] (round 6): A:10>4, B:9>8, C:1<8 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:10>9, B:9>2, C:1<9 → win A and B.\n\nWow, this might be a good allocation.\n\n[A10 B9 C1].\n\nLet's verify:\n\nTotal: 10+9+1=20.\n\nAgainst Round 6's [4,8,8]: A:10>4, B:9>8, C:1<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst Round 5's [9,2,9]: A:10>9, B:9>2, C:1<9 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst Round 4's [9,2,9]: same as above.\n\nAgainst Round 2's [10,4,6]: A:10=10 (tie), B:9>4, C:1<6 → win B only. Lose.\n\nOh, problem. If Alpha does [10,4,6], then tie on A, win B, lose C. Only one win.\n\nBut Round 2 was a while ago. Have they used high A since then? Round 2 was [10,4,6], then rounds 3-6 didn't have A>9 except rounds 4 and 5 had 9.\n\nSo maybe [10,9,1] is good except against 10 on A.\n\nBut if Alpha uses 10 on A again, which they did in round 2, but not since, maybe it's a risk worth taking.\n\nOther checks:\n\nAgainst Round 1's [8,8,4]: A:10>8, B:9>8, C:1<4 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [7,7,6]: A:10>7, B:9>7, C:1<6 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nAgainst [5,5,10]: A:10>5, B:9>5, C:1<10 → win A and B.\n\nGood.\n\nOnly loses if Alpha has ≥10 on A and ≥9 on B, but with 20 units, if they put 10 on A and 9 on B, that's 19, leaving 1 for C. So [10,9,1]. If they mirror this, it's a tie. But unlikely they'd do the exact same.\n\nIf they do [10,8,2], then [10,9,1] vs [10,8,2]: A tie, B:9>8, C:1<2 → win B only. Lose.\n\nBut again, speculative.\n\nGiven that this allocation [10,9,1] would have won against all of Alpha's previous moves except Round 2, which was a while ago, and considering that Alpha might not use [10,4,6] again, this seems promising.\n\nWait, Round 2 was [10,4,6]. If they do something like [10,5,5], then [10,9,1] would have A tie, B:9>5, C:1<5 → win B only. Lose.\n\nSo if Alpha uses high A and moderate B and C, this allocation fails.\n\nBut given their recent pattern of sacrificing B or A, maybe less likely.\n\nAlternatively, another allocation: [9,10,1].\n\nSimilar idea, high on B.\n\nBut let's not complicate.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, maybe [10,9,1] is a solid choice that covers most scenarios from recent rounds.\n\nAlternatively, [9, 10, 1], but similar.\n\nWait, but in Round 3, Alpha did [4,10,6]. Against [10,9,1], that would be A:10>4, B:9<10, C:1<6 → only A. Lose.\n\nAh, right. If Alpha focuses on high B, like [4,10,6], then [10,9,1] only wins A.\n\nBut in Round 3, that's what happened, and I used [7,6,7] to win A and C.\n\nSo if Alpha does high B again, [10,9,1] is weak.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is tricky. No allocation covers everything.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to go for [8, 9, 3].\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:8>4, B:9>8, C:3<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:8<9, B:9>2, C:3<9 → only B. Lose.\n\nAgainst [4,10,6]: A:8>4, B:9<10, C:3<6 → only A. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, back to the [2,9,9] idea.\n\nIt loses to [9,2,9] but wins against many others.\n\nGiven that Alpha used [9,2,9] two rounds in a row (4 and 5), then switched, it's less likely they'd do it a third time in round 7.\n\nRound 7 is their third move after switching in round 6.\n\nSo maybe they're more likely to continue with a different strategy.\n\nThus, [2,9,9] could be good.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n[ A2 B9 C9 ]\n\nAgainst Round 6's [4,8,8]: B and C win.\n\nAgainst Round 5's [9,2,9]: only B wins (lose).\n\nAgainst Round 4's [9,2,9]: same.\n\nAgainst Round 3's [4,10,6]: B:9<10, C:9>6, A:2<4 → only C. Lose.\n\nOh no! Wait, [4,10,6] from round 3.\n\n[2,9,9] vs [4,10,6]:\n\nA:2 <4 → lose\n\nB:9 <10 → lose\n\nC:9 >6 → win\n\nOnly one win. Lose.\n\nSo this allocation also loses to high B strategies.\n\nProblematic.\n\nHmm.\n\nSo [2,9,9] loses to both [9,2,9] and [4,10,6].\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternative idea: find an allocation that wins against both high B and high A/C.\n\nFor example, [7, 7, 6]. But as before, not great.\n\nWait, [6, 8, 6].\n\nNo.\n\nWait, [7, 6, 7] which won round 3.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:7>4, B:6<8, C:7<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nNot good now.\n\nPerhaps the most robust is to use [8, 7, 5].\n\nWait:\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:8>4, B:7<8, C:5<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, I'm going in circles.\n\nLet's try to use game theory. In Colonel Blotto, common strategies include splitting 8-8-4, 7-7-6, etc., but with 20 units.\n\nWait, another approach: the optimal strategy often involves permutations of (a, b, c) where a > b > c and a + b + c =20, aiming to cover two fields.\n\nBut given the opponent's history, adapt.\n\nGiven that in the last round Alpha used [4,8,8], which has low A, and I beat it with high A and C.\n\nThey might respond by increasing A.\n\nSuppose they do [6,7,7].\n\nTo beat that, I need two fields >. For example, [7,8,5].\n\nA:7>6, B:8>7, C:5<7 → win A and B.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nYes.\n\nTest [7,8,5].\n\nAgainst [6,7,7]: win A and B.\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:7>4, B:8=8, C:5<8 → win A only. Lose.\n\nAh, problem.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:7<9, B:8>2, C:5<9 → win B only. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if [8, 6, 6].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:8>4, B:6<8, C:6<8 → only A. Lose.\n\nNo.\n\nWait, time to make a decision.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think the allocation that has worked recently when I won rounds 5 and 6 was focusing on two fields with high numbers.\n\nIn round 5, [10,3,7] beat [9,2,9].\n\nIn round 6, [7,3,10] beat [4,8,8].\n\nSo varying the high field between A and C, with low B.\n\nFor round 7, maybe go high on B and one other.\n\nWait, or continue the pattern: round 5 high A, round 6 high C, round 7 high B?\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since in round 6 they had high B and C, maybe this time they'll go high A and B.\n\nSo I should go high on C and one other.\n\nAlternatively, use [3,4,13]. No, too extreme.\n\nWait, another idea. In round 6, I used [7,3,10] which worked. If Alpha thinks I'll do similar, they might up C.\n\nSo to counter, maybe lower C and increase elsewhere.\n\nBut hard to say.\n\nGiven all this, I'll go with [5, 9, 6].\n\nWait:\n\n[5,9,6] totals 20.\n\nAgainst Round 6's [4,8,8]: A:5>4, B:9>8, C:6<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst Round 5's [9,2,9]: A:5<9, B:9>2, C:6<9 → win B only.\n\nBut if Alpha has changed from [9,2,9], this could work.\n\nAgainst [5,7,8]: A:5=5, B:9>7, C:6<8 → win B only.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, [6, 9, 5].\n\nSame issue.\n\nWait, [7, 9, 4].\n\nAgainst [4,8,8]: A:7>4, B:9>8, C:4<8 → win A and B.\n\nAgainst [9,2,9]: A:7<9, B:9>2, C:4<9 → win B only.\n\nAgainst [4,10,6]: A:7>4, B:9<10, C:4<6 → win A only.\n\nLose.\n\nBut if Alpha is no longer using [4,10,6], this might be okay.\n\nGiven that the last two Alpha allocations were [9,2,9] and [4,8,8], and assuming they might do something like [5,7,8] next, [7,9,4] would win A and B.\n\nI think this is a reasonable guess.\n\nSo I'll go with [A7 B9 C4].\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I'm Commander Alpha in this Colonel Blotto game. We've had seven rounds so far, and now it's Round 8. The current score is tied 3-3. I need to figure out the best way to allocate my 20 troops across fields A, B, and C.\n\nFirst, I should look at the previous allocations from both sides to spot any patterns or tendencies. Let me list out what Commander Beta has done in each round:\n\n- Round 1: A8 B8 C4\n- Round 2: A9 B9 C2\n- Round 3: A7 B6 C7\n- Round 4: A7 B7 C6\n- Round 5: A10 B3 C7\n- Round 6: A7 B3 C10\n- Round 7: A7 B9 C4\n\nHmm, Beta seems to have a pattern of varying their allocations but often putting more on A. Let's check the averages. For field A: 8,9,7,7,10,7,7. Adding those up: 8+9=17, +7=24, +7=31, +10=41, +7=48, +7=55. Average A: 55/7 ≈ 7.86. So around 8 on average for A.\n\nField B: 8,9,6,7,3,3,9. Total: 8+9=17+6=23+7=30+3=33+3=36+9=45. Average B: 45/7 ≈ 6.43. So a bit lower than A.\n\nField C: 4,2,7,6,7,10,4. Total: 4+2=6+7=13+6=19+7=26+10=36+4=40. Average C: 40/7 ≈ 5.71.\n\nWait, but looking at Beta's allocations, they sometimes go high on C (like Round 6 with 10) and sometimes low. Also, in Round 5, they put 10 on A, which was higher than usual.\n\nIn my previous allocations as Alpha:\n\n- Round 1: A8 B8 C4\n- Round 2: A10 B4 C6\n- Round 3: A4 B10 C6\n- Round 4: A9 B2 C9\n- Round 5: A9 B2 C9\n- Round 6: A4 B8 C8\n- Round 7: A8 B4 C8\n\nHmm, I've been varying a lot. For example, in Rounds 4 and 5 I did A9 B2 C9, but Beta countered that with A10 B3 C7 in Round 5, which beat me because they took A and C. Wait, no: in Round 5, I had A9, Beta had A10, so Beta took A. I had C9, Beta had C7, so I took C. Then B: I had B2 vs Beta's B3, so Beta took B. Wait, but to win the round you need two fields. So in Round 5, Beta had A and B, I had C. So Beta won.\n\nSo maybe Beta is adapting to my previous moves. For instance, when I did high on A and C (like Rounds 4 and 5), Beta upped A to 10. When I did high on B (Round 3 with B10), Beta put B6 vs my B10, but they had A7 and C7, so they won A and C. Wait, Round 3: Beta had A7 vs my A4, so Beta took A. My B10 vs their B6, I took B. C: my 6 vs their 7, they took C. So Beta won A and C, hence the round.\n\nIn Round 7, I did A8 B4 C8. Beta did A7 B9 C4. So I took A (8>7), Beta took B (9>4), and C was 8 vs 4 so I took C. So I won A and C.\n\nNow, looking at Beta's recent moves, especially Round 7: A7 B9 C4. So they put a lot on B. In Round 6, they had B3, but then in Round 7 jumped to B9. Maybe they're trying to exploit if I put low on B.\n\nWait, in Round 6, I had B8, which was higher than their B3, so I took B, but they had C10 which beat my C8. So they won C and A (7>4), so Beta won that round.\n\nIn Round 7, I adjusted to B4, which was low, but Beta went high on B (9), so they took B, but I took A and C.\n\nSo maybe Beta is sometimes putting high on one field to try to win two. For example, in Round 2, Beta had A9 B9 C2. So they won A and B, but I had C6 which beat their C2, but since they had two fields, they would have won, but wait no: Round 2 says Commander Alpha won. Wait, let me check:\n\nRound 2: Alpha A10 B4 C6 vs Beta A9 B9 C2. So A: 10>9 (Alpha), B: 4<9 (Beta), C:6>2 (Alpha). So Alpha won A and C, hence the round. Oh right, so Beta's strategy of high A and B didn't work because Alpha had high A.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is sometimes spreading out or concentrating.\n\nLooking at Beta's last few rounds:\n\nRound 5: A10 B3 C7\n\nRound 6: A7 B3 C10\n\nRound 7: A7 B9 C4\n\nSo they're shifting where they put the high numbers. In Round 5, high A; Round 6, high C; Round 7, high B. So maybe they're rotating which field they emphasize.\n\nGiven that, as Alpha, I need to anticipate where Beta might go next. Since they did high B in Round 7, maybe they'll switch to high A or C in Round 8.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they'll repeat a previous pattern. Let's see:\n\nAfter Round 1 (A8 B8 C4), Round 2 they did A9 B9 C2 (similar, but more on A and B, less on C).\n\nRound 3: A7 B6 C7 (more balanced).\n\nRound 4: A7 B7 C6.\n\nRound 5: A10 B3 C7 (high A, low B).\n\nRound 6: A7 B3 C10 (low B, high C).\n\nRound 7: A7 B9 C4 (high B, low C).\n\nSo the pattern for Beta in recent rounds (5-7) seems to be shifting the high allocation: A, then C, then B. Maybe next they'll go back to A? Or perhaps cycle again.\n\nIf they're cycling through high A, high C, high B, the next might be high A again. But Round 5 was high A, then 6 high C, 7 high B. So maybe Round 8 would be high A again? Or maybe not. Alternatively, they might go for a balanced approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at my own previous moves as Alpha:\n\nIn Round 7 I did A8 B4 C8. Beta responded with A7 B9 C4. So they beat me on B but lost A and C.\n\nFor Round 8, if I think Beta might go high on A again (like Round 5), I should put more on A. Or if they might go high on B again, but they just did that in Round 7, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Beta will try to counter my previous move. In Round 7, I did A8 B4 C8. Beta's response was A7 B9 C4. So they saw my low B and high A/C, so they put high B to take B and low C, but since I had high C, I took C, and they lost A.\n\nWait, in Round 7, Beta's allocation was A7 B9 C4. So against my A8 B4 C8, they lost A, won B, lost C. So they only won one field.\n\nPerhaps Beta will adjust for Round 8. If they think I might do something similar to Round 7 (A8 B4 C8), they might increase A to beat my A8, say A9 or A10, and maybe adjust B and C.\n\nBut since I'm Commander Alpha, I need to choose an allocation that can beat possible Beta strategies.\n\nAnother approach: since the score is tied 3-3, this round is crucial. I need to maximize my chance to win two fields.\n\nCommon strategies in Blotto include spreading resources, focusing on two fields, or trying to mirror the opponent.\n\nLooking at historical data, often players allocate in a way that two fields have higher numbers. For example, in my Round 2: A10 B4 C6 (focusing on A and C), which worked.\n\nIn Round 4: A9 B2 C9 (focusing on A and C), which worked against Beta's A7 B7 C6 (they won B and A? Wait no: Round 4, Alpha A9 B2 C9 vs Beta A7 B7 C6. So A:9>7, B:2<7, C:9>6. So Alpha won A and C, hence the round. Correct.\n\nBut in Round 5, Beta countered with A10 B3 C7. So they upped A to 10, which beat my A9, took B (3>2), and C7 vs my C9, so I took C. So Beta won A and B.\n\nSo when I focus on A and C with 9 each, if Beta does A10, they can take A and possibly B if they put enough there.\n\nSo maybe varying where I focus is better.\n\nAlternative idea: since Beta's recent moves have been shifting high allocations (A, C, B), perhaps they'll do A again. So if I put high on B and C, assuming Beta goes high on A.\n\nFor example, if Beta does A10 again, then I need to have B and C such that I win both. So if Beta A10, then I need B > whatever they put on B, and C > whatever on C.\n\nBut they have 20 total. If they put 10 on A, they have 10 left for B and C. So possible splits like B5 C5, B6 C4, B4 C6, etc.\n\nIf I put, say, B7 and C7, that's 14, so A would be 6. But 6 might be less than Beta's A10. So I lose A, but if B7 > their B (say 5) and C7 > their C (5), then I win B and C.\n\nBut Beta could choose to put more on one of B or C. For example, if Beta does A10 B8 C2, then my B7 would lose to B8, but C7 would beat C2. So I'd only win C, and lose A and B. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, if I do A5 B8 C7. Then if Beta does A10, I lose A, but if their B and C are, say, B5 C5, then I win B and C.\n\nBut Beta might not split evenly. This is tricky.\n\nAnother angle: looking at Beta's average allocations:\n\nA: ~7.86, B: ~6.43, C: ~5.71.\n\nBut in recent rounds (5-7), Beta's A has been 10,7,7; B 3,3,9; C7,10,4.\n\nSo maybe Beta is trying to keep A around 7-10, but varies B and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Beta is using a strategy of high on one field and medium on others.\n\nWait, in Round 5: A10 (high), B3 (low), C7 (medium)\n\nRound 6: A7 (medium), B3 (low), C10 (high)\n\nRound 7: A7 (medium), B9 (high), C4 (low)\n\nAh, this looks like a pattern: in each of the last three rounds, Beta has one high (10), one medium (around 7), and one low (3 or 4). Specifically:\n\nRound 5: High A (10), Med C (7), Low B (3)\n\nRound 6: High C (10), Med A (7), Low B (3)\n\nRound 7: High B (9), Med A (7), Low C (4)\n\nSo they're rotating which field is high, which is med, which is low.\n\nIf this pattern continues, Round 8 might be High A again? Wait, the rotation seems to be A, C, B for high. So next would be... A again? Because it's a cycle of three. Round 5: A high, Round 6: C high, Round 7: B high. So the order is A -> C -> B, which is a cycle. Then Round 8 would be back to A high.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So following the pattern, Round 8 Beta might go High A, Med on another, Low on the third.\n\nAssuming the pattern continues:\n\nRound 5: High A (10), Med C (7), Low B (3)\n\nRound 6: High C (10), Med A (7), Low B (3)\n\nRound 7: High B (9), Med A (7), Low C (4)\n\nRound 8: High A (maybe 10 again), Med on B or C, Low on the remaining.\n\nWait, in Round 5, after High A, Med was C and Low B.\n\nRound 6: High C, Med A, Low B.\n\nRound 7: High B, Med A, Low C.\n\nSo the Med field is sometimes A, but not sure. Alternatively, the Low field has been B in Rounds 5 and 6, then C in 7. Maybe next Low is A?\n\nBut perhaps the rotation for High is A, C, B, then A again.\n\nAssuming Round 8 Beta does High A, say A10, then Med and Low on B and C.\n\nIf Beta's pattern is High A=10, then remaining 10 for B and C. In Round 5, they did B3 C7 (so Low B, Med C). If they follow a similar split, maybe B4 C6 or something.\n\nBut to counter High A, I should put enough on A to beat their likely high, but not too much. Wait, if they go A10, to beat that I need A11, but then I have 9 left for B and C. If I do A11 B5 C4, but then if they have, say, B3 C7, I'd have B5 > B3, but C4 < C7. So I'd win A and B, lose C. That's good.\n\nBut if Beta instead does A10 B6 C4, then my A11 beats A10, B5 vs B6 I lose B, C4 vs C4 tie? Wait, but troops are integers, so maybe C4 vs C4 is a tie, but need to win two fields. If A is won by me, B by Beta, C tie, then it's a tie round. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I shouldn't go too high on A. Another strategy is to focus on two fields where I think Beta is weak.\n\nGiven the pattern, if Beta is doing High A, Low B (as in Round 5), then I should focus on B and C.\n\nIn Round 5, Beta had A10 B3 C7. So Low B (3). If I put, say, B4 and C8, then I have A8. Wait, but total 20. A8 B4 C8 sums to 20.\n\nWait, in Round 3, I did A4 B10 C6 and lost because Beta had A7 B6 C7. Wait, no: Round 3, I had A4 vs Beta A7 (lose A), B10 vs B6 (win B), C6 vs C7 (lose C). So Beta won A and C.\n\nBut if I can identify where Beta is low, I can put just enough to beat that.\n\nAssuming Round 8 Beta follows the pattern of High A (10), Low B (3-4), and Med C (6-7).\n\nIf Beta's allocation is A10 B3 C7 (like Round 5), then to beat them I need:\n\n- A: >10 (but that's 11, leaving 9)\n\n- B: >3 (so 4 or more)\n\n- C: >7 (so 8 or more)\n\nBut 11+4+8=23 which is over 20. Not possible. So I can't beat all three.\n\nBut I need to win two. So options:\n\n- Focus on A and B: A11 B4 C5. Then vs Beta A10 B3 C7: win A and B, lose C. Good.\n\n- Focus on B and C: A3 B4 C13. Then vs Beta: lose A, win B (4>3), win C (13>7). So win two.\n\nBut A3 is very low; if Beta didn't go high on A, this could be bad.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta's pattern is High A, but maybe they choose different numbers. Suppose Beta does A9 B2 C9 (wait, but that's similar to my Round 4 and 5). No, Beta's recent high was 10, then 10, then 9.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: look at my previous winning allocations.\n\nI won Rounds 2,4,7.\n\nRound 2: A10 B4 C6. How did that win? Against Beta A9 B9 C2. So won A and C.\n\nRound 4: A9 B2 C9. Against Beta A7 B7 C6. Won A and C.\n\nRound 7: A8 B4 C8. Against Beta A7 B9 C4. Won A and C.\n\nAh! In all the rounds I won, I focused on A and C, with medium to high numbers there, and low on B.\n\nIn Round 2: A10 (high), C6 (medium), B4 (low)\n\nRound 4: A9 and C9 (high on both), B2 (very low)\n\nRound 7: A8 and C8, B4.\n\nWhereas when I lost:\n\nRound 3: A4 B10 C6. Focused on B, but Beta won A and C.\n\nRound 5: A9 B2 C9 (same as Round 4), but Beta did A10 B3 C7. So Beta won A and B.\n\nRound 6: A4 B8 C8. Beta did A7 B3 C10. Beta won A and C.\n\nSo the strategy of focusing on A and C worked when Beta didn't counter A. Specifically, in Round 5, Beta upped A to 10, which beat my A9.\n\nSo perhaps to make the A and C focus work, I need to have A high enough to counter Beta's possible high A.\n\nIn Round 7, I did A8, which beat Beta's A7.\n\nIf Beta is likely to go high on A again (as per the pattern), maybe I should go A9 or A10.\n\nBut in Round 5, I did A9 and Beta did A10. So maybe this time go A10.\n\nLet's say I do A10 B3 C7. Wait, but that's exactly what Beta did in Round 5. Wait, no, in Round 5 Beta did A10 B3 C7.\n\nWait, if I do A10 B3 C7, and Beta does something else... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, A10 B2 C8. Sum 20.\n\nIf Beta is going A10 again, then A10 vs A10 is a tie. Then need to win B and C. But if Beta has B3 C7, then my B2 < B3, C8 > C7. So I win C, tie A, lose B. Only one win. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, A11 B2 C7. But 11+2+7=20. If Beta has A10, I win A. If their B is 3, I lose B (2<3), C7 vs their C7 is tie. So only win A. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, the key is to win two fields. So perhaps allocate so that two fields are just above what Beta might have.\n\nGiven Beta's pattern of rotating high fields, and assuming Round 8 they go High A (like Round 5), with A10, then B low (3), C med (7).\n\nTo beat that, I need to win two of:\n\nA: need >10 (11), but expensive.\n\nB: >3 (4)\n\nC: >7 (8)\n\nSo if I do A11 B4 C5: beats A and B.\n\nOr A3 B4 C13: beats B and C.\n\nBut A3 is risky if Beta doesn't go high on A.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta breaks the pattern and does something else.\n\nAnother angle: Beta might anticipate that I'm focusing on A and C, so they might up their B or C.\n\nWait, in Round 7, I did A8 B4 C8. Beta responded with A7 B9 C4. So they focused on B, which I had low.\n\nSo for Round 8, if Beta thinks I'll do A and C again, they might go high on B.\n\nBut in Round 7 they already did high B, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, they might go high on C this time.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider mixed strategies or common Blotto tactics.\n\nA common tactic is to allocate in a way that two fields sum to just over half. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of Nash equilibrium, but that's complex without knowing the exact distribution.\n\nGiven the history, let's see what worked for me before. When I won, I had strong A and C. When I lost Round 5, it was because Beta increased A to 10.\n\nSo maybe this time, go A9 B3 C8. Let's check sum: 9+3+8=20.\n\nIf Beta does A10 B3 C7 (like Round 5):\n\n- A: 9 <10 → lose\n\n- B: 3 vs 3 → tie\n\n- C:8 >7 → win\n\nSo only one win (C), tie B. Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nIf I do A10 B3 C7:\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7: all ties. Bad.\n\nIf Beta does A9 B9 C2 (like Round 2):\n\nA10 >9, B3 <9, C7>2. Win A and C. Good.\n\nBut if Beta does A7 B9 C4 (Round 7 style):\n\nA10>7, B3<9, C7>4. Win A and C.\n\nBut if Beta does A10 B4 C6 (hypothetical):\n\nA10 tie, B3<4, C7>6. Only C win.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, A9 B4 C7. Sum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA9<10, B4>3, C7=7 (tie). So win B only. Bad.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: in the previous round (Round 7), Beta did A7 B9 C4. So they went high on B. Maybe this time they'll go high on C, following their rotation (A,C,B then next A, but they did A,C,B in 5,6,7; so Round 8 might be A again).\n\nWait, Round 5: A high\n\nRound 6: C high\n\nRound 7: B high\n\nSo the order is A, C, B. Then Round 8 would be A again.\n\nAssuming Beta does A10, B3, C7 again.\n\nTo beat that, need to win two fields.\n\nIf I do A11 B4 C5:\n\n- A11 >10\n\n- B4 >3\n\n- C5 <7\n\nWin A and B: good.\n\nSum: 11+4+5=20. Perfect.\n\nBut is A11 too risky? If Beta doesn't go A10, say they go balanced, like A7 B7 C6.\n\nThen A11 >7, B4 <7, C5 <6. Only win A. Not enough.\n\nBut given the pattern, it's more likely they go high on A.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta varies.\n\nBut given the previous three rounds' pattern, it's plausible.\n\nAnother option: A10 B5 C5.\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA tie, B5>3, C5<7. Win B only.\n\nNot good.\n\nA12 B3 C5:\n\nA12>10, B3 vs B3 tie, C5<7. Win A only.\n\nNope.\n\nA11 B5 C4:\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA win, B win, C lose. Good.\n\nAgainst a balanced Beta (7,7,6):\n\nA win, B lose (5<7), C lose (4<6). Only A. Bad.\n\nBut if Beta is following the pattern, the first scenario is more likely.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in Round 5 Beta did A10 B3 C7, and I lost with A9 B2 C9.\n\nIf I increase A to 10 and adjust.\n\nWait, A10 B3 C7 is what Beta did. If I do A10 B4 C6:\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA tie, B4>3, C6<7. Win B only.\n\nNot good.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if I do A9 B5 C6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA9<10, B5>3, C6<7. Win B only.\n\nNo good.\n\nA11 B3 C6:\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA win, B tie, C6<7. Win A only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nA11 B4 C5: as before, wins A and B.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if Beta does something else, like Round 6 style: A7 B3 C10.\n\nAgainst A11 B4 C5:\n\nA win (11>7), B win (4>3), C lose (5<10). So win A and B. Good.\n\nIf Beta does Round 7 style: A7 B9 C4.\n\nA11>7, B4<9, C5>4. Win A and C. Good.\n\nIf Beta does a balanced 7,7,6:\n\nA11>7, B4<7, C5<6. Win A only. Tie round? Wait, no: win only A, so lose the round.\n\nBut if Beta is following the rotation pattern, they're more likely to have a high on one field, so the balanced scenario might be less likely.\n\nGiven that in the last three rounds Beta has been doing high on one field, it's reasonable to assume they'll continue that pattern.\n\nThus, A11 B4 C5 seems solid against their recent strategies.\n\nBut let's check all recent Beta allocations against A11 B4 C5:\n\nRound 5 Beta (A10 B3 C7):\n\nA11>10, B4>3, C5<7 → Win A,B → Good.\n\nRound 6 Beta (A7 B3 C10):\n\nA11>7, B4>3, C5<10 → Win A,B → Good.\n\nRound 7 Beta (A7 B9 C4):\n\nA11>7, B4<9, C5>4 → Win A,C → Good.\n\nWow, this allocation beats all three of Beta's recent moves. That's promising.\n\nWait, in Round 7 Beta had C4, so my C5 would beat it.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd in Round 6, C10, I lose C but win A and B.\n\nSo regardless of which field Beta goes high on, A11 B4 C5 wins two fields.\n\nThat seems like a solid choice.\n\nLet me verify the sums: 11+4+5=20. Correct.\n\nAnother check: if Beta breaks pattern and does something else, like A8 B8 C4 (Round 1).\n\nA11>8, B4<8, C5>4 → Win A,C. Good.\n\nOr A9 B9 C2:\n\nA11>9, B4<9, C5>2 → Win A,C.\n\nYes.\n\nThe only time it might fail is if Beta does high on two fields, but given their recent pattern of one high, it's less likely.\n\nFor example, if Beta does A10 B10 C0 (unlikely, but possible):\n\nA11>10, B4<10, C5>0 → Win A,C. Still good.\n\nOr A0 B10 C10:\n\nA11>0, B4<10, C5<10 → Win A only. Bad.\n\nBut Beta hasn't done low on A before; their lowest A was 7 in recent rounds.\n\nSo the risk is low.\n\nTherefore, A11 B4 C5 seems like a strong move.\n\nWait, but in the output format it's [Ax By Cz], so [A11 B4 C5].\n\nBut I need to check if previous moves have used 11. In Round 2, I used A10, but not 11. Possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A10 B5 C5.\n\nBut against Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA tie, B win, C lose. Only one win.\n\nNo good.\n\nA12 B3 C5:\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta A10 B3 C7:\n\nA win, B tie, C lose. Only one win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nSo A11 B4 C5 is better.\n\nAnother angle: in Round 7, I did A8 B4 C8. Beta did A7 B9 C4. I won.\n\nIf I do A similar but adjust. Maybe A9 B4 C7.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Beta's recent:\n\nRound 5: A10 B3 C7 → A9<10, B4>3, C7=7 → Win B only.\n\nNot good.\n\nRound 6: A7 B3 C10 → A9>7, B4>3, C7<10 → Win A,B.\n\nRound 7: A7 B9 C4 → A9>7, B4<9, C7>4 → Win A,C.\n\nSo it wins against 6 and 7, but loses to 5.\n\nWhereas A11 B4 C5 wins against all three.\n\nThus, A11 B4 C5 seems superior.\n\nI think that's the best bet.\n",

The next round is critical for momentum.\n\nLooking at the history of Commander Alpha's allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\nRound 2: A10 B4 C6\nRound 3: A4 B10 C6\nRound 4: A9 B2 C9\nRound 5: A9 B2 C9  (same as round 4)\nRound 6: A4 B8 C8\nRound 7: A8 B4 C8\n\nPatterns:\n- Alpha often puts a lot on A and C, but sometimes shifts.\n- In rounds 4 and 5, Alpha used A9 B2 C9 (very heavy on A and C, light on B).\n- In round 6, Alpha used A4 B8 C8 (light on A, heavy on B and C).\n- In round 7, Alpha used A8 B4 C8 (moderate on A, light on B, heavy on C).\n\nNotice that in rounds 4,5,7: Alpha has consistently put at least 8 on C? \nRound 4: C9, Round 5: C9, Round 6: C8, Round 7: C8 -> so C is often high.\n\nAlso, A: \nRound 1:8, 2:10, 3:4, 4:9, 5:9, 6:4, 7:8 -> seems to alternate between high (8,9,10) and low (4).\n\nB:\nRound1:8, 2:4, 3:10, 4:2, 5:2, 6:8, 7:4 -> often low (2 or 4) but sometimes high (8 or 10).\n\nSince we are tied and it's round 8, Alpha might try to anticipate our pattern. \n\nOur own history (Commander Beta) as Commander Beta:\n\nRound1: A8 B8 C4 -> tie\nRound2: A9 B9 C2 -> lost (Alpha had A10 B4 C6: won A and C? \n   A: Beta9 < Alpha10 -> Alpha wins A\n   B: Beta9 > Alpha4 -> Beta wins B\n   C: Beta2 < Alpha6 -> Alpha wins C -> Alpha wins 2 out of 3 -> correct)\nRound3: A7 B6 C7 -> won (vs A4 B10 C6: \n   A:7>4 -> Beta wins A\n   B:6<10 -> Alpha wins B\n   C:7>6 -> Beta wins C -> Beta wins A and C -> correct)\nRound4: A7 B7 C6 -> lost (vs A9 B2 C9:\n   A:7<9 -> Alpha wins A\n   B:7>2 -> Beta wins B\n   C:6<9 -> Alpha wins C -> Alpha wins A and C -> correct)\nRound5: A10 B3 C7 -> won (vs A9 B2 C9:\n   A:10>9 -> Beta wins A\n   B:3>2 -> Beta wins B\n   C:7<9 -> Alpha wins C -> Beta wins A and B -> correct)\nRound6: A7 B3 C10 -> won (vs A4 B8 C8:\n   A:7>4 -> Beta wins A\n   B:3<8 -> Alpha wins B\n   C:10>8 -> Beta wins C -> Beta wins A and C -> correct)\nRound7: A7 B9 C4 -> lost (vs A8 B4 C8:\n   A:7<8 -> Alpha wins A\n   B:9>4 -> Beta wins B\n   C:4<8 -> Alpha wins C -> Alpha wins A and C -> correct)\n\nSo our pattern:\n- We often put 7 on A (rounds 3,4,6,7) except round 2 (9) and round5 (10)\n- On B: round2:9, round3:6, round4:7, round5:3, round6:3, round7:9 -> variable\n- On C: round1:4, round2:2, round3:7, round4:6, round5:7, round6:10, round7:4 -> also variable\n\nBut note: in round 5 we put 10 on A, which worked because Alpha had 9 on A. In round 6 we put 10 on C, which worked because Alpha had 8 on C.\n\nNow, for round 8, we need to win two fields. We have to anticipate what Alpha might do.\n\nLooking at Alpha's recent moves (rounds 4-7):\n\nRound4: A9 B2 C9\nRound5: A9 B2 C9 (same)\nRound6: A4 B8 C8\nRound7: A8 B4 C8\n\nIt seems Alpha might be alternating between two strategies:\n- Strategy 1 (rounds 4,5): heavy on A and C (9 each), light on B (2)\n- Strategy 2 (rounds 6,7): heavy on B and C (round6: B8 C8, round7: B4 C8 -> but note C is always 8 or 9, and A is 4 or 8)\n\nHowever, round7 was A8 B4 C8, which is different from round6 (A4 B8 C8). So perhaps:\n\n- When Alpha has a low A (4), they have a high B (8) and high C (8) [round6]\n- When Alpha has a moderate A (8), they have a low B (4) and high C (8) [round7]\n\nAnd in rounds 4 and 5, high A (9) and high C (9) with very low B (2).\n\nGiven that, what might Alpha do in round 8?\n\nSince round7 was A8 B4 C8, which is similar to rounds 4 and 5 in that C is high (8 vs 9) and A is high (8 vs 9), but B is 4 (vs 2). \n\nBut note: in round7, Alpha won by having more on A and C. \n\nWe might expect Alpha to stick with a similar pattern? Or change?\n\nAnother idea: Alpha might try to exploit our pattern. What does our pattern look like?\n\nWe have:\n- A: often 7 (in rounds 3,4,6,7) -> so 4 times out of 6 recent rounds (rounds 2-7) we put 7 on A? \n  Actually: \n    round2: A9\n    round3: A7\n    round4: A7\n    round5: A10\n    round6: A7\n    round7: A7\n  So 4 out of 6 we put 7 on A.\n\n- B: \n    round2:9, round3:6, round4:7, round5:3, round6:3, round7:9 -> no clear single number, but often low in rounds 5 and 6 (3) and high in 2 and 7 (9).\n\n- C: \n    round2:2, round3:7, round4:6, round5:7, round6:10, round7:4 -> no clear pattern.\n\nBut note: when we put 7 on A (which is common), Alpha might try to beat us on A by putting 8 or more? However, in round7, Alpha put 8 on A and beat our 7.\n\nSo to win on A, we might need at least 8 or 9.\n\nBut if we put 8 or 9 on A, then we have less for B and C.\n\nAlternatively, we might avoid A and focus on B and C.\n\nLooking at Alpha's C: in the last 4 rounds (4-7) they have put 9,9,8,8 -> so at least 8 on C.\n\nSo if we want to win on C, we need at least 9? But in round6 we put 10 and won (because Alpha had 8). In round5 we put 7 and lost (Alpha had 9). \n\nSimilarly, for B: Alpha has put 2,2,8,4 in the last 4 rounds. So sometimes very low (2) and sometimes moderate (4) or high (8).\n\nGiven that, perhaps Alpha will put a low number on B again? Because in rounds 4,5,7 they put 2,2,4 (which are low). Only round6 was high (8).\n\nSo if we put a moderate amount on B (say 5 or 6) we might win B if Alpha has 4 or less.\n\nBut in round6, Alpha had 8 on B and we lost B because we put only 3 (round6: we had B3 vs Alpha B8). So we have to be cautious.\n\nAnother idea: since Alpha has been putting a lot on C (at least 8 in the last 4 rounds), maybe we can try to win A and B and let C go? But then we need to win A and B.\n\nWhat does Alpha put on A? \nRound4:9, round5:9, round6:4, round7:8 -> so sometimes high (9), sometimes moderate (8) or low (4).\n\nSimilarly for B: \nRound4:2, round5:2, round6:8, round7:4 -> so sometimes very low (2), sometimes moderate (4) or high (8).\n\nSo we might try to put a lot on A and B, but which one to prioritize?\n\nLet me try to predict Alpha's move for round 8.\n\nGiven the sequence:\n\nRound4: A9 B2 C9\nRound5: A9 B2 C9 (repeated)\nRound6: A4 B8 C8 (shifted)\nRound7: A8 B4 C8 (shifted again)\n\nRound8: ? \n\nIt might be that Alpha is cycling. Round7 was A8 B4 C8. What if round8 is similar to round6? But round6 was A4 B8 C8. \n\nAlternatively, it might be that after two similar moves (rounds4,5) they changed. Then after two moves that are not identical (round6 and 7) they might change again.\n\nRound6: A4 B8 C8\nRound7: A8 B4 C8\n\nRound8: maybe A4 B4 C12? But that's not allowed (max 20). Or A4 B8 C8 again? \n\nBut note: in round6 they had A4 B8 C8 and we (Beta) won by putting A7 B3 C10 -> so we won A and C.\n\nIn round7, they changed to A8 B4 C8 and we lost because we put A7 (which was less than 8) and C4 (less than 8). We won B because we put 9 vs their 4.\n\nSo for round8, Alpha might try to do something different to avoid our pattern.\n\nGiven that we have been winning by sometimes putting high on A (round5:10) or high on C (round6:10), Alpha might spread more evenly? Or they might try to put a lot on two fields that we have been weak on.\n\nBut note: in the last round (round7) we lost because we put 7 on A (vs their 8) and 4 on C (vs their 8). So they might expect us to put more on A and C next time.\n\nTherefore, Alpha might put less on A and C and more on B? \n\nFor example, Alpha might try: A6 B10 C4? But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, they might stick with high C (since it's been high for 4 rounds) and then distribute the rest.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I propose a balanced approach that covers the likely scenarios.\n\nWe want to win two fields. We note:\n\n- C is likely to be high for Alpha (at least 8 in recent rounds), so to win C we need at least 9. But if we put 9 on C, then we have 11 left for A and B.\n\n- A: sometimes high (9,10) for Alpha, sometimes low (4). So if we put 8 on A, we might beat a low A (like 4) but lose to a high A (like 9 or 10). But if we put 10 on A, we might beat their high A (if they have 9) but then have less for B.\n\n- B: sometimes very low (2), sometimes moderate (4) or high (8). So if we put 6 on B, we might beat their low B (2 or 4) but lose to high B (8).\n\nSo let's consider:\n\nOption 1: Focus on A and B.\n  - Put enough on A to beat their likely A (if they have 4 or 8, but maybe not 9 or 10). But if we put 9 on A, then we have 11 left for B and C. \n  - Then put, say, 7 on B (to beat their typical low B of 2 or 4, but might lose to 8) and 4 on C (which is likely too low since they have at least 8).\n\nBut then we win A and B only if they don't have high on A and high on B. But if they have high on A (9 or 10) we lose A, and if they have high on B (8) we lose B. Then we lose both and C is lost too.\n\nOption 2: Focus on B and C.\n  - Put 9 on C (to beat their typical C of 8 or 9? but if they have 9, we need 10 to win? Actually, if we have 9 and they have 9, it's a tie? But the problem says: win two battlefields. And in the rules, if tie on a field, then no one wins that field? Actually, in round1: both had 8,8,4 -> tie round. So a tie on a field doesn't count as a win for either.\n\n  Therefore, to win a field, we must have strictly more.\n\n  So for C: if Alpha has 8, we need at least 9; if Alpha has 9, we need at least 10.\n\n  Given that Alpha has had 9,9,8,8 in the last 4 rounds, we might assume they will have at least 8. So to be safe, we need 10 on C? But that leaves only 10 for A and B.\n\n  Then we could put 5 on A and 5 on B? But then:\n    - If Alpha has A=9, we lose A (5<9)\n    - If Alpha has B=2, we win B (5>2) -> but if they have B=8, we lose B.\n\n  So we win only B? Not enough.\n\n  Alternatively, put 6 on A and 4 on B? Then:\n    - If Alpha has A=4, we win A (6>4); if A=8, we lose (6<8); if A=9, lose.\n    - If Alpha has B=2, we win B (4>2); if B=8, we lose.\n\n  So we might win A and B only if they have low A and low B? But their low A is 4 (which we beat with 6) and low B is 2 (which we beat with 4). But if they have moderate A (8) we lose A, and if they have high B (8) we lose B.\n\n  And if they have high A (9) and high B (8), we lose both.\n\n  But note: they don't usually have high A and high B at the same time? \n    Round4: A9 B2 -> so high A, low B.\n    Round5: same.\n    Round6: A4 B8 -> low A, high B.\n    Round7: A8 B4 -> moderate A, low B.\n\n  So they never had both high A and high B? \n\n  Therefore, if we put 6 on A and 4 on B, then:\n    - If they have high A (9 or 10) and low B (2 or 4): \n        A: 6 < 9 -> lose A\n        B: 4 > 2 or 4? if B=2: 4>2 -> win; if B=4: 4=4 -> tie -> no win? so we don't win B? \n        Actually, if they have B=4, then 4 vs 4 is tie -> no win for B.\n        So we win only if they have B<=3? but they have had 2,4 -> so if they have 2 we win B, if 4 it's tie.\n\n    - If they have low A (4) and high B (8):\n        A: 6>4 -> win A\n        B: 4<8 -> lose B\n        So we win only A -> not enough.\n\n    - If they have moderate A (8) and low B (4):\n        A: 6<8 -> lose\n        B: 4=4 -> tie -> no win\n        So we win nothing? \n\n  This is risky.\n\nOption 3: Focus on A and C.\n  - Put 10 on A (to beat their high A of 9) and 10 on C (to beat their high C of 9) -> but 10+10=20, so B=0. \n    But then:\n      - If they have A=10, we tie A -> no win.\n      - If they have A=9, we win A (10>9)\n      - If they have C=9, we win C (10>9)\n      - But if they have A=10, we tie A and we have B=0 so if they have any on B we lose B -> then we win only C? \n        But wait: if they have A=10, B=something, C=9, then:\n          A: tie -> no win\n          B: we have 0, they have at least 1? -> they win B\n          C: we win C (10>9) -> so we win only one field -> lose the round.\n\n  So not safe.\n\n  Alternatively, put 9 on A and 10 on C -> total 19, then 1 on B.\n    Then:\n      - If they have A=9: tie -> no win for A.\n      - If they have A=8: we win A (9>8)\n      - If they have C=9: we win C (10>9)\n      - If they have C=8: we win C (10>8) -> but we win C for sure? \n        However, if they have A=10: \n          A: 9<10 -> lose\n          B: 1 vs ? if they have B=2, then we lose B (1<2); if they have B=1, tie; if they have B=0, we win? but they won't have 0 probably.\n        So we win only C -> not enough.\n\n  So we need to win two fields. Therefore, we must have two fields where we exceed their allocation.\n\n  Given that, and the patterns, I think a good strategy is to:\n\n  - Assume Alpha will put at least 8 on C (based on last 4 rounds). So we put 9 on C? But if they put 9, we tie. So to win C we need 10. But then we have 10 left.\n\n  - For A: they have put 9,9,4,8 in the last 4. So sometimes 9, sometimes less. If we put 9 on A, then we have 1 left for B (if we put 10 on C) -> total 9+10+1=20.\n\n    Then:\n      - C: 10 -> we win C unless they put 10 or more? but they have never put 10 on C (max 9 so far). So we win C for sure.\n      - A: 9 -> we win A if they put <=8, but lose if they put >=10? but they have put 9 twice (so tie) and 4 and 8. \n          If they put 9: tie -> no win for A.\n          If they put 4 or 8: we win A (9>4 and 9>8).\n          If they put 10: we lose A (9<10).\n      - B: 1 -> we win B only if they put 0, which they haven't. They have put at least 2. So we lose B.\n\n    So outcomes:\n      - If they put 9 on A: we tie A, lose B, win C -> only one win -> lose round.\n      - If they put 4 or 8 on A: we win A and C -> two wins -> win round.\n      - If they put 10 on A: we lose A, lose B, win C -> one win -> lose round.\n\n    Given that they have put 9 twice (rounds4,5) and 8 once (round7) and 4 once (round6), it's a bit risky.\n\n  But note: in round7 they put 8 on A, so if they repeat that pattern we win. But they might put 9 again.\n\n  Alternatively, we can put 10 on A and 9 on C, and 1 on B.\n\n    Then:\n      - A: 10 -> we win A if they put <=9, tie if 10, lose if 11 (but max 20, so unlikely 11? but they could put 10).\n      - C: 9 -> we win C if they put <=8, tie if 9, lose if 10.\n      - B: 1 -> lose unless they put 0.\n\n    Outcomes:\n      - If they put 9 on A and 9 on C (like rounds4,5): \n          A: 10>9 -> win A\n          C: 9=9 -> tie -> no win for C\n          B: lose -> so we win only A -> lose round.\n      - If they put 8 on A and 8 on C (like round6? but round6 they had C8, but A was 4; round7: A8 C8):\n          A: 10>8 -> win A\n          C: 9>8 -> win C -> win round.\n      - If they put 4 on A and 8 on C (like round6):\n          A: 10>4 -> win A\n          C: 9>8 -> win C -> win round.\n      - If they put 10 on A and 8 on C? \n          A: 10=10 -> tie\n          C: 9>8 -> win C -> only one win -> lose round.\n\n    But note: they have never put 10 on A and 8 on C together? But they could.\n\n    However, they have put 10 on A only in round2 (with B4 C6). So if they repeat round2: A10 B4 C6, then:\n        A: 10=10 -> tie\n        B: 1<4 -> lose\n        C: 9>6 -> win -> only one win -> lose.\n\n    So this allocation (A10 C9 B1) wins only if they don't have high A and high C at the same time? But they have had high A and high C (rounds4,5: A9 C9) and then we lose.\n\n    But in rounds4,5 they had B2, so if we had put more on B we could have won B? but we put 1, so we lose B.\n\n    However, in rounds4,5 we would have won A (10>9) but tied C (9=9) and lost B -> so only one win.\n\n    So not good.\n\nAnother idea: since Alpha has been putting very low on B in rounds 4,5,7 (2,2,4), we can try to win B by putting, say, 5 on B. Then we have 15 for A and C.\n\nWe want to win A and C as well? But we only need two wins. So if we win B and one other, that's enough.\n\nSo:\n  B: 5 (to beat their typical B of 2,4, but might lose to 8)\n  Then 15 for A and C.\n\n  How to split A and C? \n    - If we split evenly: A7 C8 -> total 5+7+8=20.\n    - Then:\n        If Alpha has A9, C9 (like rounds4,5): \n            A: 7<9 -> lose\n            B: 5>2 -> win\n            C: 8<9 -> lose -> only one win -> lose round.\n        If Alpha has A4, C8 (round6):\n            A:7>4 -> win\n            B:5<8 -> lose\n            C:8=8 -> tie -> no win -> only A -> one win -> lose.\n        If Alpha has A8, C8 (round7):\n            A:7<8 -> lose\n            B:5>4 -> win\n            C:8=8 -> tie -> only B -> one win -> lose.\n\n    Not good.\n\n  Alternatively, put more on C: A5 C10, B5.\n    Then:\n      Rounds4,5: A9 B2 C9\n        A:5<9 -> lose\n        B:5>2 -> win\n        C:10>9 -> win -> two wins -> win round.\n      Round6: A4 B8 C8\n        A:5>4 -> win\n        B:5<8 -> lose\n        C:10>8 -> win -> two wins -> win round.\n      Round7: A8 B4 C8\n        A:5<8 -> lose\n        B:5>4 -> win\n        C:10>8 -> win -> two wins -> win round.\n\n    This seems to work for all recent rounds!\n\n    Let me check:\n      Round4: Alpha A9 B2 C9 -> we: A5 B5 C10\n        A: 5<9 -> Alpha wins A\n        B: 5>2 -> Beta wins B\n        C:10>9 -> Beta wins C -> Beta wins B and C -> two wins -> win.\n\n      Round5: same as round4 -> same result.\n\n      Round6: Alpha A4 B8 C8 -> we: A5 B5 C10\n        A:5>4 -> Beta wins A\n        B:5<8 -> Alpha wins B\n        C:10>8 -> Beta wins C -> Beta wins A and C -> two wins -> win.\n\n      Round7: Alpha A8 B4 C8 -> we: A5 B5 C10\n        A:5<8 -> Alpha wins A\n        B:5>4 -> Beta wins B\n        C:10>8 -> Beta wins C -> Beta wins B and C -> win.\n\n    Perfect! So with [A5 B5 C10] we would have won rounds 4,5,6,7.\n\n    But note: in round4 we actually lost with [A7 B7 C6] vs [A9 B2 C9] -> because we had 7<9 on A, 7>2 on B, 6<9 on C -> only B -> lost.\n\n    So this new allocation would have won.\n\n    However, is Alpha likely to use the same patterns? \n\n    But round8: we don't know. But this allocation seems robust against their recent patterns.\n\n    What if Alpha changes? For example, if Alpha puts 10 on B? \n        Then: B:5<10 -> lose B.\n        Then we need to win A and C.\n        We have A5 and C10.\n        If Alpha puts, say, A3 and C7: \n            A:5>3 -> win\n            C:10>7 -> win -> still win.\n        But if Alpha puts A6 and C7:\n            A:5<6 -> lose\n            C:10>7 -> win -> only one win -> lose.\n\n    However, Alpha has never put more than 10 on a single field? Actually, in round2 they put A10. But they haven't put 10 on B.\n\n    Also, if Alpha puts a lot on B, say 10, then they have only 10 for A and C. So they might put 5 on A and 5 on C? \n        Then:\n          A:5=5 -> tie\n          B:5<10 -> lose\n          C:10>5 -> win -> only one win -> we lose.\n\n    But wait, if they put 10 on B, then A and C together are 10. They might put 10 on A and 0 on C? \n        Then:\n          A:5<10 -> lose\n          B:5<10 -> lose\n          C:10>0 -> win -> one win -> lose.\n\n    Or they put 0 on A and 10 on C? \n        Then:\n          A:5>0 -> win\n          B:5<10 -> lose\n          C:10=10 -> tie -> only A -> one win -> lose.\n\n    So if they put 10 on B, we lose.\n\n    But how likely is that? In the last 7 rounds, Alpha has put:\n        B: 8,4,10,2,2,8,4 -> the maximum on B is 10 (round3) and 8 (rounds1,6). \n        So 10 on B has happened once (round3).\n\n    Therefore, it's possible but not the most common.\n\n    Given that, and the fact that this allocation wins against their most recent patterns (4 rounds in a row), it's a good bet.\n\n    Also, note that in round3 they had B10 and we (Beta) had B6 -> we lost B. But with B5 we would have lost too. However, in round3 we won because we had A7 (vs their A4) and C7 (vs their C6) -> so we won A and C. \n\n    But with our new allocation [A5 B5 C10] in round3:\n        Alpha: A4 B10 C6\n        We: A5 B5 C10\n        A:5>4 -> win\n        B:5<10 -> lose\n        C:10>6 -> win -> two wins -> win.\n\n    So actually it would have won round3 as well.\n\n    Let's check round2:\n        Alpha: A10 B4 C6\n        We: A5 B5 C10\n        A:5<10 -> lose\n        B:5>4 -> win\n        C:10>6 -> win -> two wins -> win.\n\n    Round1:\n        Alpha: A8 B8 C4\n        We: A5 B5 C10\n        A:5<8 -> lose\n        B:5<8 -> lose\n        C:10>4 -> win -> only one win -> lose.\n\n    But round1 we tied with [A8 B8 C4] so it was a tie. With this we would have lost? \n        Actually, in round1: \n          A: Alpha8 vs Beta8 -> tie\n          B: Alpha8 vs Beta8 -> tie\n          C: Alpha4 vs Beta4 -> tie? but we are putting C10? \n        Wait, no: in round1 we (Beta) actually put [A8 B8 C4] as per the log. But if we had put [A5 B5 C10] in round1, then:\n          A: 5<8 -> Alpha wins\n          B: 5<8 -> Alpha wins\n          C:10>4 -> Beta wins -> so Alpha wins two fields -> Alpha wins the round.\n\n        But the actual round1 was a tie because both put the same.\n\n    However, we are not constrained by round1 because we are in round8. And round1 was a different context.\n\n    Given that [A5 B5 C10] would have won rounds 2,3,4,5,6,7 (only lost round1, which was a tie in reality) and we are tied at 3-3 now, it's a strong allocation.\n\n    But note: in the actual game, we won rounds 3,5,6 and lost 1,2,4,7. So if we had used [A5 B5 C10] in all rounds, we would have won rounds 2,3,4,5,6,7 -> 6 wins, which is great.\n\n    However, the opponent might have changed their strategy if we had done that. But since we didn't, they might still be using the same pattern.\n\n    Therefore, for round8, I propose [A5 B5 C10].\n\n    But wait: total is 5+5+10=20, perfect.\n\n    Let me double-check the output format: [A5 B5 C10]\n\n    However, note that in the problem statement: \"each ≥0\" and integers, which is satisfied.\n\n    But is there a risk? \n\n    The main risk is if Alpha puts 11 or more on B? But they can't because total is 20. Max on one field is 20. But if they put 11 on B, then A+C=9. \n        Then:\n          A: we have 5, they have at most 9 -> but we don't know how they split A and C.\n          However, we have:\n            A: 5 vs their A (at most 9) -> if they put 6 or more on A, we lose A; if 5 or less, we win or tie.\n            C:10 vs their C (at most 9) -> we win C for sure.\n          And B:5<11 -> lose B.\n\n          So we win C and possibly A -> if we win A, then two wins; if not, only one win.\n\n        Specifically, if they put 5 on A and 4 on C (with B11), then:\n            A:5=5 -> tie -> no win\n            C:10>4 -> win -> only one win -> lose.\n\n        If they put 4 on A and 5 on C, then:\n            A:5>4 -> win\n            C:10>5 -> win -> two wins -> win.\n\n        So it depends on how they split A and C.\n\n        But if they put 11 on B, they have 9 for A and C. They might put 9 on A and 0 on C? \n            A:5<9 -> lose\n            C:10>0 -> win -> only one win -> lose.\n\n        Or 0 on A and 9 on C? \n            A:5>0 -> win\n            C:10>9 -> win -> two wins -> win.\n\n        So it's 50-50? But note: Alpha is trying to win, so they would put more on A and C to try to beat us? \n\n        However, without knowing their exact split, it's risky. But the chance of them putting 11 on B is low (they haven't done that in the past).\n\n    Given the historical data, Alpha has never put more than 10 on B (only once in round3). And 11 is even higher.\n\n    So the probability is low.\n\n    Therefore, [A5 B5 C10] seems like a solid choice.\n\n    But note: in round7, Alpha had C8. If they put C9 again, we have C10 which beats it. If they put C10, then we tie C -> no win for C. Then we need to win A and B.\n\n        A: we have 5, they have ? \n        B: we have 5, they have ?\n\n        If they put A10 and B0 (with C10), then:\n          A:5<10 -> lose\n          B:5>0 -> win\n          C:10=10 -> tie -> only B -> one win -> lose.\n\n        But they won't put B0 because they need to win fields. \n\n        If they put A9 and B1 (C10), then:\n          A:5<9 -> lose\n          B:5>1 -> win\n          C: tie -> only B -> lose.\n\n        If they put A4 and B6 (C10), then:\n          A:5>4 -> win\n          B:5<6 -> lose\n          C: tie -> only A -> lose.\n\n        So if they put 10 on C, we lose unless they also put low on A and low on B? but if they put 10 on C, they have 10 left for A and B. They might put 5 on A and 5 on B? \n          Then:\n            A:5=5 -> tie\n            B:5=5 -> tie\n            C: tie -> all tie -> tie round.\n\n        But we don't want a tie; we want to win.\n\n        However, if they put 10 on C, then they have 10 for A and B. They might put 6 on A and 4 on B? \n          Then:\n            A:5<6 -> lose\n            B:5>4 -> win\n            C: tie -> only B -> lose.\n\n        Or 4 on A and 6 on B? \n          A:5>4 -> win\n          B:5<6 -> lose\n          C: tie -> only A -> lose.\n\n        So if they put 10 on C, we cannot get two wins? because we tie C, and then we can win at most one of A or B.\n\n        Therefore, if Alpha puts exactly 10 on C, we tie and then we need to win both A and B? but we have only 10 for A and B, and they have 10 too. But we have 5 on A and 5 on B. They might mirror us? \n\n        However, if they put 5 on A and 5 on B, then tie on all -> tie.\n\n        But if they put 6 on A and 4 on B, we lose A and win B -> one win.\n\n        So we cannot get two wins if they put 10 on C.\n\n        But note: Alpha has never put 10 on C in the past. The highest they put on C is 9 (rounds4,5). So it's unlikely.\n\n    Given the above, the only real risk is if they put 10 on C, but they haven't done that. The next highest risk is if they put 11 on B, which is also unlikely.\n\n    Therefore, I think [A5 B5 C10] is a good move for round8.\n\n    Let's output that.\n\n    Note: The problem says \"Think privately in ",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to come up with an allocation for the final round of Colonel Blotto. Right now, the score is Commander Alpha: 3, Commander Beta: 4. Since it's the last round, whoever wins this round will take the game. So Alpha needs to win this round to tie the overall score 4-4? Wait, wait, no. Wait, each round is a separate win, and the total rounds are 9. The problem says \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So each round, the player who wins the majority of battlefields (i.e., at least two out of three) wins that round. The overall game is best of 9 rounds? Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So each round is a separate instance where you allocate troops, and the winner of the round is the one who wins two battlefields. Then, after 9 rounds, whoever has won more rounds wins the game.\n\nBut in the current state, after Round 8, it's 3-4 in favor of Beta. So Round 9 is the last one. If Alpha wins Round 9, the total becomes 4-4, but since it's 9 rounds, maybe it's a tie? Wait, the problem says \"Rounds Won - Commander Alpha: 3, Commander Beta: 4\" going into Round 9. So if Alpha wins Round 9, it's 4-4. But the problem might be that the game is up to 9 rounds, and the winner is whoever has more round wins. So 4-4 would be a tie, but maybe the problem expects that. However, the user's instruction says \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So each round is a separate win. The goal is to win the majority of rounds? Wait, the initial problem statement says: \"Two players simultaneously allocate 20 troops across three battlefields (A, B, C). Win two battlefields per round.\" So per round, win two battlefields to win the round. Then, over 9 rounds, the one with more round wins takes the game.\n\nBut in this case, after Round 8, Alpha has 3, Beta has 4. So Round 9 is critical. If Alpha wins Round 9, it's 4-4. If Beta wins, it's 3-5. But maybe the problem is structured such that the game ends when someone reaches 5 round wins? Wait, no, it's specified as Round 9/9, so it's a fixed 9 rounds. So the final score could be 4-4, but the problem might just be about winning the round.\n\nBut the user's current task is just to allocate for Round 9. The goal is to win Round 9, which would make the total rounds won 4-4, but since it's the last round, that's the best Alpha can do. However, maybe Beta is leading 4-3, so Alpha needs to win this round to tie 4-4. But regardless, for this round, Alpha needs to try to win the round (i.e., win two battlefields).\n\nNow, looking at previous rounds to see if there's a pattern in Beta's allocations. Let's list out all Beta's allocations from previous rounds:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\n\nRound 2: A9 B9 C2\n\nRound 3: A7 B6 C7\n\nRound 4: A7 B7 C6\n\nRound 5: A10 B3 C7\n\nRound 6: A7 B3 C10\n\nRound 7: A7 B9 C4\n\nRound 8: A5 B5 C10\n\nHmm. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Beta seems to sometimes spread out, sometimes concentrate.\n\nIn Round 1, Beta matched Alpha's allocation exactly (since it was a tie).\n\nRound 2: Beta did 9,9,2. Alpha did 10,4,6. So Beta won B (9>4) and A (9<10? Wait no, Round 2: Alpha A10 vs Beta A9: Alpha wins A. Beta B9 vs Alpha B4: Beta wins B. C: Alpha 6 vs Beta 2: Alpha wins C. So Alpha won A and C, Beta won B. So Alpha won two, hence winner.\n\nRound 3: Beta 7,6,7. Alpha 4,10,6. So A: Beta 7 > Alpha 4; B: Alpha 10 > Beta 6; C: Beta 7 > Alpha 6. So Beta wins A and C, Alpha wins B. Beta wins round.\n\nRound 4: Beta 7,7,6. Alpha 9,2,9. A: Alpha 9>7; B: Beta 7>2; C: Alpha 9>6. Alpha wins A and C, so wins round.\n\nRound 5: Beta 10,3,7. Alpha 9,2,9. A: Beta 10>9; B: Alpha 2 vs Beta 3: Beta wins B (3>2); C: Alpha 9>7. So Beta wins A and B, Alpha wins C. Beta wins round.\n\nRound 6: Beta 7,3,10. Alpha 4,8,8. A: Beta 7>4; B: Alpha 8>3; C: Beta 10>8. Beta wins A and C, wins round.\n\nRound 7: Beta 7,9,4. Alpha 8,4,8. A: Alpha 8>7; B: Beta 9>4; C: Alpha 8>4. Alpha wins A and C, wins round.\n\nRound 8: Beta 5,5,10. Alpha 11,4,5. A: Alpha 11>5; B: Alpha 4 vs Beta 5: Beta wins B; C: Alpha 5 vs Beta 10: Beta wins C. So Beta wins B and C, wins round.\n\nSo looking at Beta's allocations:\n\n- In Round 1: even split (8,8,4)\n- Round 2: high on A and B (9,9,2)\n- Round 3: balanced (7,6,7)\n- Round 4: balanced (7,7,6)\n- Round 5: high A and C (10,3,7)\n- Round 6: high A and C (7,3,10)\n- Round 7: high B (7,9,4)\n- Round 8: high C (5,5,10)\n\nHmm. Beta seems to vary, but there's a trend of sometimes putting a lot on C (Rounds 6,8). Also, in Round 5, Beta had 10 on A. Round 7 had 9 on B.\n\nBut perhaps Beta is reacting to Alpha's previous moves. Let's see Alpha's allocations:\n\nRound 1: 8,8,4 (tie)\n\nRound 2: 10,4,6 (Alpha wins)\n\nRound 3: 4,10,6 (Beta wins)\n\nRound 4: 9,2,9 (Alpha wins)\n\nRound 5: 9,2,9 (Beta wins)\n\nRound 6: 4,8,8 (Beta wins)\n\nRound 7: 8,4,8 (Alpha wins)\n\nRound 8: 11,4,5 (Beta wins)\n\nSo Alpha has been varying. In Round 4 and 5, Alpha did 9,2,9. Then in Round 6, switched to 4,8,8, then Round 7: 8,4,8, Round 8: 11,4,5.\n\nBeta's response in Round 9 is unknown, but we need to predict.\n\nSince it's the final round, and Beta knows that Alpha might try to counter previous patterns.\n\nLooking at Beta's last few allocations:\n\nRound 6: 7,3,10\n\nRound 7:7,9,4\n\nRound 8:5,5,10\n\nSo Round 8 Beta put 10 on C again. Round 6 also 10 on C.\n\nIn Round 8, Beta had 5,5,10. Alpha went 11,4,5. So Alpha won A (11>5), but lost B (4<5) and C (5<10). So Beta won B and C.\n\nIn Round 7, Beta had 7,9,4. Alpha went 8,4,8. So Alpha won A and C.\n\nRound 6: Beta 7,3,10 vs Alpha 4,8,8. Beta won A and C.\n\nSo Beta seems to have a tendency to put high numbers on C in recent rounds (Rounds 6 and 8). Round 7 was different with high B.\n\nBut maybe Beta is trying to vary, but since in Round 8 Beta did 5,5,10, perhaps for Round 9 Beta might do something else. However, as Alpha, I need to choose an allocation that can beat likely Beta allocations.\n\nAnother angle: in order to win two battlefields, need to have higher than Beta on two fields.\n\nGiven that Beta has used high C in recent rounds, maybe Beta will do high C again. Or maybe Beta will switch.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might anticipate that Alpha will try to counter high C by putting more on C, so Beta might lower C and increase elsewhere.\n\nBut it's a game of simultaneous moves, so hard to know.\n\nLet's think of possible strategies.\n\nCommon strategies in Blotto include spreading out, or focusing on two fields.\n\nSince total is 20, to win two fields, need to have at least two fields where you have more than Beta.\n\nPossible allocations:\n\nIf Beta is expected to go high on C (like 10 again), then to beat C, Alpha needs at least 11. But 11 on C leaves 9 for A and B. If Beta has, say, 5 on A and 5 on B (like Round 8), then Alpha could do 5 on A, 4 on B, 11 on C. But wait, 5+4+11=20. Then Alpha would win C (11>10), but if Beta has A5, B5, then Alpha's A5 vs Beta A5 is a tie? Wait, no: in Blotto, typically if equal, it's a tie for that field, so neither wins. So to win a field, you need strictly more.\n\nSo in Round 8, Alpha had A11 vs Beta A5: Alpha wins A.\n\nB: Alpha 4 vs Beta 5: Beta wins.\n\nC: Alpha 5 vs Beta 10: Beta wins.\n\nSo Beta won B and C.\n\nTherefore, if Beta does similar to Round 8 (5,5,10), then Alpha needs to have >5 on two fields.\n\nFor example, if Alpha does 6,6,8. Then:\n\nA:6>5, B:6>5, C:8<10. So Alpha wins A and B.\n\nBut 6+6+8=20. Yes.\n\nBut would Beta do 5,5,10 again? Maybe not, since it worked last time, but Beta might vary.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do something like 6,6,8.\n\nWait, but how to anticipate.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in Beta's allocations.\n\nLooking at Beta's allocations:\n\nRound 1: 8,8,4\n\nRound 2:9,9,2\n\nRound3:7,6,7\n\nRound4:7,7,6\n\nRound5:10,3,7\n\nRound6:7,3,10\n\nRound7:7,9,4\n\nRound8:5,5,10\n\nLooking at the C values: 4,2,7,6,7,10,4,10. So C has been increasing in recent rounds (Round 6:10, Round8:10). Rounds 6 and 8 both had C=10.\n\nSimilarly, A values: 8,9,7,7,10,7,7,5. So A was high in Round5 (10), then lower.\n\nB values:8,9,6,7,3,3,9,5. B was low in Rounds5-6 (3 each), then up in 7 (9), down in 8 (5).\n\nSo perhaps Beta is cycling or trying different strategies.\n\nAlternatively, Beta might be countering Alpha's previous move.\n\nFor example:\n\nRound1 Alpha:8,8,4; Beta:8,8,4 (match)\n\nRound2 Alpha:10,4,6; Beta:9,9,2 (maybe Beta thought Alpha would go high on A, so Beta went high on B and A but slightly less on A)\n\nBut not sure.\n\nRound3 Alpha:4,10,6; Beta:7,6,7 (Beta put more on A and C, which Alpha was low on)\n\nRound4 Alpha:9,2,9; Beta:7,7,6 (Beta put more on B and C? Wait Alpha had 2 on B, so Beta put 7 to take B. But Alpha had 9 on A and C, Beta had 7 and 6, so Alpha won A and C.)\n\nRound5 Alpha:9,2,9; Beta:10,3,7 (Beta put 10 on A to beat Alpha's 9, 3 on B (which is more than Alpha's 2), and 7 on C (less than Alpha's 9). So Beta wins A and B.)\n\nRound6 Alpha:4,8,8; Beta:7,3,10 (Beta takes A and C)\n\nRound7 Alpha:8,4,8; Beta:7,9,4 (Beta takes B, Alpha takes A and C)\n\nRound8 Alpha:11,4,5; Beta:5,5,10 (Beta takes B and C)\n\nSo Beta seems to respond by targeting the fields where Alpha is weak.\n\nFor example, when Alpha has low on B (Rounds 4 and 5 had B=2), Beta put more on B (7 and 3). Wait Round4 Beta B=7, which beat Alpha's 2. Round5 Beta B=3, which beat Alpha's 2.\n\nSimilarly, when Alpha had high on A (Round8:11), Beta went low on A (5), but high on C.\n\nSo perhaps Beta is trying to allocate more on the fields where Alpha has less.\n\nGiven that, what did Alpha do in Round8? A11, B4, C5.\n\nBeta responded with A5, B5, C10. So Beta put just enough to beat Alpha's B and C (B5 >4, C10>5), while conceding A.\n\nTherefore, for Round9, Alpha needs to choose an allocation such that Beta cannot easily target two fields.\n\nPerhaps Alpha should avoid having any very low numbers, since Beta seems to target the lowest fields.\n\nIn Round8, Alpha's B was 4 and C was 5, both low, and Beta targeted those.\n\nSo maybe Alpha should balance more, or have two fields with moderate numbers.\n\nAlternatively, go high on two fields.\n\nTotal is 20. To win two fields, need to have two fields where Alpha's allocation > Beta's.\n\nAssuming Beta will try to minimize the fields Alpha can win.\n\nA common tactic is to use a 6-6-8 distribution, which covers two fields with 8 each, but 6+6+8=20.\n\nWait 6+6+8=20. Yes.\n\nOr 7-7-6.\n\nWait, but need to think what Beta might do.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha does 7-7-6, then Beta would need to have more than 7 on two fields, which would require at least 8+8+4=20. So Beta could do 8,8,4. Then Beta would win A and B, Alpha wins C. But if Beta does 8,8,4, then Alpha's 7,7,6 would lose A and B.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if Alpha does 9-9-2. Then Beta would need to beat 9 on two fields, which would require 10+10+0, but total is 20. 10+10+0 is 20, but then Beta would win two fields. But if Beta does 10,10,0, then Alpha's 9,9,2 would lose A and B, win C. So Beta wins.\n\nBut maybe Alpha should go for a more balanced approach.\n\nWait, looking at previous rounds where Alpha won:\n\nRound2: A10 B4 C6. Beta did A9 B9 C2. So Alpha won A and C.\n\nRound4: A9 B2 C9. Beta did A7 B7 C6. Alpha won A and C.\n\nRound7: A8 B4 C8. Beta did A7 B9 C4. Alpha won A and C.\n\nAh! A pattern here. In the rounds Alpha won, they focused on winning A and C, with high numbers there, and low on B.\n\nIn Round2: A10, C6\n\nRound4: A9, C9\n\nRound7: A8, C8\n\nAnd Beta in those rounds:\n\nRound2 Beta: A9, B9, C2 → Alpha's A10 >9, C6>2 (but wait C6 vs C2: Alpha wins C. B: Alpha 4 <9. So Alpha wins A and C.\n\nRound4 Beta: A7, B7, C6 → Alpha A9>7, C9>6. B:2<7. So Alpha wins A and C.\n\nRound7 Beta: A7, B9, C4 → Alpha A8>7, C8>4. B:4<9. So Alpha wins A and C.\n\nSo when Alpha allocated high on A and C, and low on B, they won A and C as long as Beta didn't also go high on A and C.\n\nIn Round5, Alpha did same as Round4 (A9 B2 C9), but Beta did A10 B3 C7. So Beta A10>9, B3>2, so Beta won A and B.\n\nSo the problem was Beta went higher on A.\n\nSimilarly, in Round8, Alpha did A11 B4 C5. Beta did A5 B5 C10. So Beta won B and C.\n\nSo the strategy of high A and C works if Beta doesn't counter with higher on those.\n\nGiven that in Round8, Beta went low on A (5), maybe for Round9 Beta might go high on A again, anticipating Alpha to go high on A.\n\nBut it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, since in Round8 Alpha went very high on A (11), Beta may think Alpha will do similar, so Beta might go high on A to counter.\n\nBut if Alpha varies, perhaps going high on B and C.\n\nWait, another observation: in Round6, Alpha did A4 B8 C8, which is high on B and C. Beta did A7 B3 C10. So Beta won A and C (7>4, 10>8), Alpha won B (8>3). So Beta won the round.\n\nSo when Alpha went high on B and C, Beta took A and C.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if Alpha does something like A5 B10 C5. Total 20. Then, if Beta is expecting high A and C, but Alpha has medium A and C, high B.\n\nBut if Beta went, say, A7 B7 C6 (like Round4), then Alpha's B10 would win B, and if A5 <7 and C5 <6, then only B is won, so lose round.\n\nNot good.\n\nAlternatively, A6 B8 C6. Total 20. If Beta does something like A7 B7 C6, then A:6<7, B:8>7, C:6=6 (tie). So only B won. Not enough.\n\nNeed to win two.\n\nHow about A7 B7 C6. Same as Beta's Round4. If Beta does something else.\n\nWait, perhaps a safe allocation is to do 7-7-6. If Beta allocates evenly, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Beta's recent allocations:\n\nRound7:7,9,4\n\nRound8:5,5,10\n\nSo Beta switched from high B to high C.\n\nPossibly for Round9, Beta might go high on A, or balance.\n\nAlternatively, since Round8 Beta did 5,5,10, maybe Round9 Beta does 10,5,5 or similar.\n\nIf Beta does 10 on A, then Alpha needs to have >10 on A to win it, but that leaves 10 for B and C. If Alpha does A11 B5 C4, then against Beta's A10, Alpha wins A. Then if Beta has B5 and C5 (assuming Beta does 10,5,5), then Alpha's B5 ties, C4 loses. So only win A. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha could do A0 B10 C10. But that's risky. If Beta does any positive on A, they win A, and if Beta has, say, 7 on B and 7 on C, then Beta wins both.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother angle: the most common winning strategy in Blotto is to have two fields with n+1 where Beta has n, but it's hard without knowing Beta's move.\n\nWait, considering that in the previous round (Round8), Beta used a lot on C (10). Maybe Beta will do similar again, or switch.\n\nIf Alpha assumes Beta will do high C again (say 9 or 10), then Alpha should put at least 11 on C to win it. Then remaining 9 for A and B.\n\nTo win another field, need at least, say, 5 on A and 4 on B (5+4=9). So allocation like A5 B4 C11.\n\nCheck: 5+4+11=20.\n\nIf Beta does C=10, then Alpha's C11 wins. If Beta's A and B are both ≤4 and ≤3 respectively, but unlikely.\n\nWait, if Beta does something like A6 B4 C10.\n\nThen Alpha A5 <6, B4 =4 (tie), C11>10. So only win C. Not enough.\n\nNeed to win two.\n\nSo if Alpha does C11, then need to win one more.\n\nSuppose Beta's allocation is x,y, z where z >=10.\n\nAlpha has C11, so z <=9 (but wait Beta could do z=10 or 11). Wait total is 20.\n\nIf Beta puts 10 on C, then x+y=10.\n\nAlpha's allocation: A a, B b, C11, a+b=9.\n\nTo win two fields, need a >x and b >y (where x+y=10).\n\nBut x and y are positive numbers adding to 10.\n\nThe maximum min(x,y) is 5 (if x=5,y=5). So if Alpha sets a=6, b=3.\n\nThen if Beta has x=5,y=5: a=6>5, b=3<5: win A only.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf Alpha does a=7, b=2: then against x=6,y=4: a=7>6, b=2<4: win A.\n\nStill only one.\n\nWait, it's hard to guarantee two wins if committing 11 to C.\n\nAlternative idea: instead of going very high on one, balance to cover two fields.\n\nFor example, 8,8,4. Which was the first round.\n\nBut in Round1 it tied because Beta did same.\n\nIf Alpha does 8,8,4, and Beta does something else.\n\nSuppose Beta does 7,7,6: then Alpha wins A and B (8>7 each), loses C (4<6). So wins round.\n\nIf Beta does 9,9,2: Alpha A8<9, B8<9, C4>2: lose A and B, win C: lose round.\n\nSo risky.\n\nAnother common allocation is 7,7,6.\n\nIf Alpha does 7,7,6.\n\nAgainst Beta's possible allocations:\n\nIf Beta does 6,6,8: Alpha wins A and B (7>6), loses C: win round.\n\nIf Beta does 8,8,4: Alpha A7<8, B7<8, C6>4: lose round.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, looking back at when Alpha won rounds, they had high A and C.\n\nMaybe try that again, but adjust to avoid Beta's possible counter.\n\nIn Round7, Alpha did 8,4,8 and won because Beta did 7,9,4.\n\nSo A:8>7, C:8>4, B:4<9.\n\nIf Beta anticipates high A and C, they might go higher on A and C.\n\nBut if Alpha varies the amounts.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A9 B2 C9 again (as in Rounds4 and 5).\n\nIn Round4 it worked (Beta did 7,7,6), but in Round5 Beta countered with 10,3,7.\n\nSo if Beta does similar, 10 on A, then Alpha's A9 loses.\n\nBut maybe Beta won't do that again.\n\nAlternatively, do A10 B1 C9. Total 20.\n\nIf Beta does something like 9,9,2 (Round2), then Alpha wins A (10>9) and C (9>2), loses B. Good.\n\nBut if Beta does 11 on A, but max is 20, so 11 on A would leave 9 for B and C.\n\nWait Beta could do A11 B4 C5 (like Alpha Round8), but not sure.\n\nThis is too uncertain.\n\nAlternative approach: use the fact that in the last three rounds, Beta's allocations on C were 4 (Round7), 10 (Round8). Round6 was 10. So maybe C is a focus.\n\nIf Alpha puts 9 on C, that would beat Beta's Round7 C4 and possibly others.\n\nBut need two fields.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A8 B3 C9. Total 20.\n\nIf Beta does high C, say C=10, then Alpha's C9 loses. Not good.\n\nIf Alpha does C10, then total remaining 10 for A and B.\n\nTo win two fields, need at least two fields > Beta's.\n\nSuppose Beta uses C=9, then Alpha's C10 wins. Then need to win one more.\n\nIf Alpha does A6 B4 C10.\n\nAgainst Beta's x,y,9 where x+y=11.\n\nIf Beta does x=6, y=5: Alpha A6 ties, B4 <5: only C wins.\n\nNot enough.\n\nIf Alpha does A7 B3 C10.\n\nAgainst x=6,y=5: A7>6, C10>9: wins A and C.\n\nBut Beta could allocate x=7,y=4: then A7 tie, B3 <4, C wins: only one.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is challenging.\n\nWait, looking at all Beta's allocations, the minimum Beta has put on any field:\n\nIn Round2: C2\n\nRound5: B3\n\nRound6: B3\n\nRound7: C4\n\nRound8: A5,B5\n\nSo the lowest Beta has gone on a field is 2 (Round2 C).\n\nBut in recent rounds, minimums are higher.\n\nPerhaps Beta is unlikely to go below 3 or 4 in any field.\n\nAssuming that, if Alpha puts 5 on a field, it might be safe.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the total is 20, the average per field is ~6.66.\n\nSo allocations around 7 are average.\n\nTo win two fields, need two fields above Beta's.\n\nA possible robust allocation is 7,7,6.\n\nLet's test against previous Beta allocations:\n\nRound1 Beta:8,8,4. Alpha 7,7,6 → A:7<8, B:7<8, C:6>4 → win C only. Lose.\n\nBut Round1 was a tie with 8,8,4.\n\nRound2 Beta:9,9,2. Alpha 7,7,6 → A:7<9, B:7<9, C:6>2 → win C. Lose.\n\nRound3 Beta:7,6,7. Alpha 7,7,6 → A:tie, B:7>6, C:6<7 → win B. Tie? No, need two wins. Only B, so lose.\n\nRound4 Beta:7,7,6. Alpha 7,7,6 → all ties. Lose.\n\nRound5 Beta:10,3,7. Alpha 7,7,6 → A:7<10, B:7>3, C:6<7 → win B. Lose.\n\nRound6 Beta:7,3,10. Alpha 7,7,6 → A:tie, B:7>3, C:6<10 → win B. Lose.\n\nRound7 Beta:7,9,4. Alpha 7,7,6 → A:tie, B:7<9, C:6>4 → win C. Lose.\n\nRound8 Beta:5,5,10. Alpha 7,7,6 → A:7>5, B:7>5, C:6<10 → win A and B. Win round.\n\nSo in only Round8 would 7,7,6 win. Not great.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative allocation: 8,4,8 (like Round7).\n\nTest against previous Beta allocations:\n\nRound1: Beta 8,8,4 → A:8=8, B:4<8, C:8>4 → win C. Lose.\n\nRound2: Beta9,9,2 → A:8<9, B:4<9, C:8>2 → win C. Lose.\n\nRound3: Beta7,6,7 → A:8>7, B:4<6, C:8>7 → win A and C. Win.\n\nRound4: Beta7,7,6 → A:8>7, B:4<7, C:8>6 → win A and C. Win.\n\nRound5: Beta10,3,7 → A:8<10, B:4>3, C:8>7 → win B and C. Win.\n\nRound6: Beta7,3,10 → A:8>7, B:4>3, C:8<10 → win A and B. Win.\n\nRound7: Beta7,9,4 → A:8>7, B:4<9, C:8>4 → win A and C. Win.\n\nRound8: Beta5,5,10 → A:8>5, B:4<5, C:8<10 → win A only. Lose.\n\nWow, this allocation (8,4,8) would have won Rounds3,4,5,6,7, lost 1,2,8.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Round3: Win\n\n- Round4: Win\n\n- Round5: Win\n\n- Round6: Win\n\n- Round7: Win\n\n- Round1: Tie on A, lose B, win C → but since A tie, only one win (C), so lose round.\n\nWait no: in Round1, if Alpha does 8,4,8 and Beta does 8,8,4:\n\nA: 8 vs 8 → tie\n\nB: 4 vs 8 → Beta wins\n\nC: 8 vs 4 → Alpha wins\n\nSo Alpha only wins C, so loses the round.\n\nSimilarly Round2: A:8<9, B:4<9, C:8>2 → only C, lose.\n\nRound8: A:8>5, B:4<5, C:8<10 → only A, lose.\n\nBut in Rounds3-7, it would have won.\n\nThat's a pretty strong allocation historically.\n\nGiven that, maybe doing 8,4,8 again could be good.\n\nBut Beta may have noticed this pattern. In Round7, Alpha did 8,4,8 and won.\n\nThen in Round8, Alpha deviated to 11,4,5.\n\nSo Beta might expect a return to 8,4,8 or variation.\n\nIf Beta anticipates 8,4,8, they might allocate to beat it.\n\nTo beat 8,4,8, Beta needs >8 on two fields.\n\nFor example, Beta could do 9,5,6 (total 20). Then:\n\nA:9>8, B:5>4, C:6<8. So Beta wins A and B.\n\nOr Beta does 9,9,2: A and B >8 and 4.\n\nBut 9+9+2=20.\n\nIn Round2, Beta did 9,9,2 against Alpha's 10,4,6 and lost A, but won B.\n\nWait, if Alpha does 8,4,8 and Beta does 9,9,2:\n\nA:8<9, B:4<9, C:8>2 → Alpha only wins C. Loses.\n\nSo if Beta does 9,9,2, Alpha loses.\n\nBut will Beta do that?\n\nAlternatively, Beta might do 7,5,8.\n\nA:7<8, B:5>4, C:8=8. So Alpha wins A, Beta wins B, C tie. Alpha only one win.\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, Beta could do 9,3,8.\n\nA:9>8, B:3<4, C:8=8. Beta wins A, Alpha wins B. Tie on C. So each win one, but need two to win round. So tie round? No, the round winner is whoever has more battlefield wins. If one win each and one tie, then it's a tie round? Wait no, the problem states \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So to win the round, you need to win at least two battlefields. If it's one each and one tie, then no one wins two, so it's a tie round?\n\nBut in the game logs provided, there were ties only in Round1. Let me check:\n\nRound1: both 8,8,4 → each field tied? No:\n\nWait Round1:\n\nAlpha: A8 B8 C4\n\nBeta: A8 B8 C4\n\nSo each field is tie. Therefore, no one won any battlefield. So tie round.\n\nThe problem says \"Win two battlefields per round.\" So if you don't win two, you don't win the round. So if it's 1-1-1 or 2-1-0, etc.\n\nWait no, three battlefields. To win the round, win at least two.\n\nIf both players win one battlefield each, and one is tied, then neither has two wins, so tie round.\n\nBut in the provided game logs, only Round1 was a tie.\n\nRound2: Alpha won A and C.\n\nRound3: Beta won A and C.\n\nEtc.\n\nSo unlikely to have many ties.\n\nBack to Alpha considering 8,4,8.\n\nIf Beta expects this, they might go 9,5,6.\n\nBut it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, vary slightly: 9,4,7.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nIf Beta does 9,9,2: A tie, B:4<9, C:7>2. Win C only.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr 8,5,7.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWhat if Alpha does 7,4,9.\n\nThen against Beta's potential 9,9,2: A7<9, B4<9, C9>2: win C only.\n\nStill bad.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative idea: since in Round8 Beta won by going high on C (10), maybe they'll do that again. So Alpha should go high on C to win it, and also win one other.\n\nC needs at least 11 to beat 10.\n\nSo C11, then A and B total 9.\n\nTo win another field, say A needs >x, where x + y =9 (Beta's allocation).\n\nIf Beta puts 5 on A and 5 on B (like Round8), then Alpha could do A6 B3 C11.\n\nThen A6>5, C11>10: win two.\n\nYes.\n\nSo allocation: A6 B3 C11.\n\nCheck sum:6+3+11=20.\n\nIf Beta does similar to Round8 (5,5,10), Alpha wins A and C.\n\nIf Beta does something else, like 6,4,10: A6 tie, B3<4, C11>10: only C. Lose.\n\nBut if Beta goes 7,3,10: A6<7, B3=3 (tie), C11>10: only C.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf Beta does 4,5,11: but Beta can't do C11 and still have 9 left; C11 would mean A+B=9.\n\nWait Beta's total is 20. If Beta does C=11, then A+B=9.\n\nSo if Alpha does C11, and Beta does C=11, then tie on C.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nPerhaps safer to do C9 or 10.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nWhat if Alpha does A4 B10 C6.\n\nWait, that was Round3 allocation, which lost.\n\nNot good.\n\nOr A5 B10 C5.\n\nIf Beta does A7 B6 C7 (Round3), then Alpha A5<7, B10>6, C5<7: only B. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother historical winner for Alpha was Round4: A9 B2 C9.\n\nLet's see what would beat that.\n\nBeta needs to win two fields.\n\nSo to beat 9,2,9, Beta needs >9 on one field and >2 on another.\n\nFor example, 10,3,7: beats A and B.\n\nOr 5,5,10: beats B and C.\n\nBut if Beta does something like 8,8,4: then A9>8, C9>4, B2<8: Alpha wins.\n\nSo 9,2,9 is good against balanced allocations.\n\nGiven that Round8 Beta did 5,5,10, which beats 9,2,9 (since B5>2 and C10>9), but if Alpha varies the 9s.\n\nWhat if Alpha does A10 B1 C9.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nAgainst Beta's 5,5,10: A10>5, B1<5, C9<10: only A. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf Alpha does A9 B3 C8.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst 5,5,10: A9>5, B3<5, C8<10: only A.\n\nStill bad.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, the problem is when Beta goes high on C.\n\nTo beat a high C, need high C.\n\nBut also need another field.\n\nWhat if Alpha does C=9, and distribute the rest to win A and B.\n\nWait 9 on C, 11 left for A and B.\n\nTo win both A and B, need A and B each > Beta's.\n\nBut Beta could allocate all remaining 11 to one field.\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternative idea: use an allocation that has two fields at 7 and one at 6, but shifted.\n\nWait 7,6,7.\n\nSimilar to some Beta allocations.\n\nIf Alpha does 7,6,7.\n\nAgainst Beta's Round8 (5,5,10): A7>5, B6>5, C7<10 → win A and B. Good.\n\nAgainst Round7 Beta (7,9,4): A7=7, B6<9, C7>4 → win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round6 Beta (7,3,10): A7=7, B6>3, C7<10 → win B only.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round5 Beta (10,3,7): A7<10, B6>3, C7=7 → win B only.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round4 Beta (7,7,6): A7=7, B6<7, C7>6 → win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round3 Beta (7,6,7): all ties.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round2 Beta (9,9,2): A7<9, B6<9, C7>2 → win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round1 Beta (8,8,4): A7<8, B6<8, C7>4 → win C only.\n\nLose.\n\nSo only wins against Round8. Not great.\n\nHmm.\n\nBack to the drawing board.\n\nGiven that in Round7, 8,4,8 worked, and Round8 Beta changed to beat whatever Alpha did.\n\nIn Round8, Alpha did 11,4,5 which lost.\n\nMaybe for Round9, return to a variation of 8,4,8 but adjusted.\n\nSuppose Alpha does 8,3,9.\n\nSum 20.\n\nCheck against previous Beta allocations:\n\nRound8 Beta:5,5,10 → A8>5, B3<5, C9<10 → win A only. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nHow about 9,3,8.\n\nSame issue.\n\nWhat if 10,2,8.\n\nAgainst Round8 Beta: A10>5, B2<5, C8<10 → win A only.\n\nStill bad.\n\nWait, to beat Beta's Round8 strategy (high C), need to win C and another.\n\nSo C must be at least 11.\n\nLet's try A6 B3 C11.\n\nAs before.\n\nIf Beta does 5,5,10: win A and C.\n\nIf Beta does 6,4,10: A6 tie, so need another. B3<4, C11>10. Only C. Lose.\n\nBut if Beta is likely to do similar to Round8, which was effective, they might do high C again.\n\nAssuming Beta does C=10 or 11.\n\nIf C=10, then C11 wins.\n\nThen need one more win.\n\nIf Alpha does A7 B2 C11.\n\nThen against Beta's x,y,10 where x+y=10.\n\nAlpha needs x <7 or y <2.\n\nBut y <2 means y=0 or 1. Unlikely, Beta probably allocates at least 2.\n\nIf Beta does x=6, y=4: A7>6, so win A and C.\n\nIf Beta does x=7, y=3: A7 tie, B2<3: only C.\n\nSo risky.\n\nBut maybe Beta will not go as high on A as 7.\n\nGiven Beta's recent allocations:\n\nRound8 A=5\n\nRound7 A=7\n\nRound6 A=7\n\nRound5 A=10\n\nSo A varies.\n\nPerhaps doing A7 B2 C11.\n\nSum 20.\n\nIf Beta does A5,B5,C10: win A and C.\n\nIf Beta does A6,B4,C10: win A and C.\n\nIf Beta does A7,B3,C10: tie A, lose B, win C: only one.\n\nBut maybe Beta won't do A7.\n\nAlternatively, A8 B1 C11.\n\nThen against A7: win A.\n\nBut if Beta goes A9, then lose A.\n\nThis is tough.\n\nAnother angle: what allocation would have beaten Beta's previous moves.\n\nLet's see for each round, what Alpha could have done to win.\n\nBut maybe overcomplicating.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the safest bet is to go with a distribution that has worked before when Beta's allocation is moderate on A and C.\n\nSince 8,4,8 worked in several rounds, and Beta might not expect it again, or might overcompensate.\n\nAlternatively, do 7,4,9.\n\nWait, let's calculate.\n\nAlternatively, observe that in Round7, Alpha did 8,4,8 and won.\n\nBeta's response in Round8 was to go low on A and B, high on C.\n\nSo maybe for Round9, Beta might go high on A, expecting Alpha to go high on C.\n\nSo if Alpha goes high on B.\n\nLike A4 B12 C4.\n\nBut then Beta could do A5 B1 C14 (but C14 is over 20-5-1=14, yes). But Beta would win C.\n\nWait, this is messy.\n\nWait, a strong allocation is often 0,10,10 but risky.\n\nIf Alpha does A0 B10 C10.\n\nIf Beta does any positive on A, wins A. Then if Beta has, say, A5 B5 C10: Beta wins A and C tie, B:10>5. So Alpha wins B and ties C: wins round.\n\nWait:\n\nAlpha:0,10,10\n\nBeta:5,5,10\n\nA:0<5 → Beta\n\nB:10>5 → Alpha\n\nC:10=10 → tie\n\nSo Alpha wins only B. Needs two. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nIf Beta does A6 B7 C7:\n\nA:0<6, B:10>7, C:10>7 → win B and C. Win round.\n\nAh, so if Beta spreads out, this works.\n\nBut if Beta concentrates:\n\nBeta A10 B10 C0:\n\nA:0<10, B:10=10, C:10>0. Alpha wins C only.\n\nLose.\n\nSo very risky.\n\nProbably not good.\n\nBack to 8,4,8.\n\nGiven that it has a good historical win rate in previous Beta allocations, and it's not too extreme.\n\nEven though Beta might anticipate it, it's hard to counter without knowing.\n\nSo I'll go with A8 B4 C8.\n\nWait, but in Round8, Alpha did A11 B4 C5, and Beta won.\n\nIf Beta thinks Alpha might return to 8,4,8, they might do 9,5,6.\n\nBut without knowing, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, slightly adjust to A7 B4 C9.\n\nSum 20.\n\nLet's see:\n\nAgainst Round8 Beta (5,5,10): A7>5, B4<5, C9<10 → win A only. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nA9 B4 C7.\n\nAgainst Round8: A9>5, B4<5, C7<10 → win A only.\n\nSame issue.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhat if A5 B10 C5.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Round8 Beta (5,5,10): A5=5, B10>5, C5<10 → win B only. Lose.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, what if A6 B8 C6.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Round8: A6>5, B8>5, C6<10 → win A and B. Win.\n\nAgainst Round7 Beta (7,9,4): A6<7, B8<9, C6>4 → win C only. Lose.\n\nAgainst Round6 Beta (7,3,10): A6<7, B8>3, C6<10 → win B only. Lose.\n\nAgainst Round5 Beta (10,3,7): A6<10, B8>3, C6<7 → win B only. Lose.\n\nAgainst Round4 Beta (7,7,6): A6<7, B8>7, C6=6 → win B only. Lose.\n\nAgainst Round3 Beta (7,6,7): A6<7, B8>6, C6<7 → win B only. Lose.\n\nAgainst Round2 Beta (9,9,2): A6<9, B8<9, C6>2 → win C only. Lose.\n\nAgainst Round1 Beta (8,8,4): A6<8, B8=8, C6>4 → win C only. Lose.\n\nSo only wins against Round8. Not great.\n\nBut if Beta repeats Round8's strategy, it works.\n\nGiven that Round8's strategy worked for Beta, they might do it again.\n\nSo if we assume Beta will do similar to Round8 (5,5,10), then A6 B8 C6 wins A and B.\n\nBut if Beta varies, it might not.\n\nAlternatively, A7 B7 C6.\n\nAgainst Round8: win A and B.\n\nSimilarly.\n\nBut same issue.\n\nGiven that it's the final round and Beta won the previous round with high C, it's plausible they'll do high C again.\n\nSo Alpha should aim to win two other fields.\n\nWith C likely lost, need to win A and B.\n\nSo allocate more to A and B.\n\nTotal 20.\n\nIf C is conceded (say 0), then A+B=20.\n\nBut to win both A and B, need to have A and B each more than Beta's.\n\nBut Beta could allocate all to C, but no, Beta needs to allocate to three fields.\n\nWait, if Alpha does A10 B10 C0.\n\nThen if Beta does x,y,z with x+y+z=20.\n\nTo win A and B, need x<10 and y<10.\n\nWhich is likely, unless Beta also goes high on A or B.\n\nBut if Beta does A11 B9 C0: but C0, then Beta wins A, Alpha wins B. Tie on C (both 0?). Not sure.\n\nThis is too uncertain.\n\nBut historically, Beta hasn't gone above 10 on a single field except Round5 A10.\n\nRound5 Beta A10.\n\nSo if Alpha puts 11 on A and B.\n\nWait A11 B9 C0: sum 20.\n\nBut C0 might be bad if Beta puts anything on C.\n\nAlternatively, A9 B9 C2.\n\nIf Beta goes high on C (10), then C2 loses, but if Beta has A and B less than 9.\n\nIn Round8, Beta did A5 B5, so Alpha would win A and B.\n\nYes.\n\nA9 B9 C2.\n\nSum 20.\n\nAgainst Round8 Beta: win A and B.\n\nAgainst Round7 Beta (7,9,4): A9>7, B9=9, C2<4 → win A only.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round6 Beta (7,3,10): A9>7, B9>3, C2<10 → win A and B. Win.\n\nAgainst Round5 Beta (10,3,7): A9<10, B9>3, C2<7 → win B only.\n\nLose.\n\nAgainst Round4 Beta (7,7,6): A9>7, B9>7, C2<6 → win A and B. Win.\n\nAgainst Round3 Beta (7,6,7): A9>7, B9>6, C2<7 → win A and B. Win.\n\nAgainst Round2 Beta (9,9,2): all ties. Lose.\n\nAgainst Round1 Beta (8,8,4): A9>8, B9>8, C2<4 → win A and B. Win.\n\nSo this allocation (9,9,2) would have won Rounds1,3,4,6, lost 2,5,7,8.\n\nSpecifically, against Round8's Beta allocation, it wins.\n\nGiven that Beta used high C in Round8, 9,9,2 would win A and B.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nAdditionally, in Round2, this allocation would tie all fields (if Beta does 9,9,2), but otherwise, it has a good record.\n\nGiven that Round9 is critical, and Beta likely to repeat high C strategy, this might be a good play.\n\nSo Alpha allocates A9 B9 C2.\n\nSum 20.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me verify:\n\n9+9+2=20.\n\nIf Beta does something like 5,5,10 (Round8 style):\n\nA9>5, B9>5, C2<10 → win A and B. Win round.\n\nIf Beta does 6,4,10: same result.\n\nIf Beta does 10 on A (Round5 style), say 10,3,7:\n\nA9<10, B9>3, C2<7 → win B only. Lose.\n\nBut is Beta likely to go high on A again? After Round5, they went away from it.\n\nRecent rounds have been lower on A:\n\nRound6:7\n\nRound7:7\n\nRound8:5\n\nSo maybe not.\n\nWhereas high C has been in Rounds6 and 8.\n\nThus, A9 B9 C2 seems like a good bet.\n\nI think this is the best option.\n",

        "reasoning": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out the best allocation for the final round of Colonel Blotto. Commander Beta is leading 4-3, so winning this round would make it 5-3, securing the game. But wait, actually, since it's Round 9, the total rounds are 9, so whoever has more wins after 9 rounds wins the game. Currently, Beta has 4 wins, Alpha has 3. So Beta needs to win this round to get to 5, which is majority. If Beta loses, it's 4-4, and then maybe tiebreaker? Wait, no, 9 rounds total, so 5-4 would be the win. Wait, current score after Round 8: Alpha 3, Beta 4. So Round 9: if Beta wins, it's 5-3 for Beta. If Alpha wins, it's 4-4, but wait, 9 rounds, so 5 wins needed. Wait, 9 rounds, so maximum possible is 9 wins. Wait, no, each round is a separate win. So after 9 rounds, whoever has more round wins takes the game. So current score: Alpha 3, Beta 4. So if Beta wins Round 9, it's 5-3 Beta. If Alpha wins, it's 4-4. Wait, but 9 rounds, so 4-4 would mean one more round? Wait, no, the problem says Round 9/9, so this is the last round. So after Round 9, the total wins will determine the winner. So Beta has 4, Alpha 3. If Beta wins Round 9, final score 5-3 Beta. If Alpha wins, 4-4. Wait, but 9 rounds, so 4-4 is impossible because 9 is odd. Wait, 3+4=7 rounds done, Round 8 was the 8th. Wait, let's check:\n\nRound 1: Tie (0-0)\nRound 2: Alpha wins (1-0)\nRound 3: Beta wins (1-1)\nRound 4: Alpha (2-1)\nRound 5: Beta (2-2)\nRound 6: Beta (2-3)\nRound 7: Alpha (3-3)\nRound 8: Beta (3-4)\nSo Round 9: if Beta wins, 3-5; if Alpha wins, 4-4. Wait, but 9 rounds, so total of 9 rounds. Wait, Round 1 to 9, so 9 rounds. The score after Round 8 is Alpha 3, Beta 4. So Round 9 is the 9th round. If Beta wins Round 9, total Beta wins 5, Alpha 3. If Alpha wins Round 9, Beta 4, Alpha 4. But 4-4 after 9 rounds? Wait, 3+4=7 wins accounted for, Round 9 will add one more, so total 8 wins? Wait, no. Each round, either one player wins or it's a tie. Wait, looking back:\n\nRound 1: Tie (so no one gets a win)\nRound 2: Alpha wins (Alpha 1)\nRound 3: Beta wins (Beta 1)\nRound 4: Alpha (Alpha 2)\nRound 5: Beta (Beta 2)\nRound 6: Beta (Beta 3)\nRound 7: Alpha (Alpha 3)\nRound 8: Beta (Beta 4)\nSo after 8 rounds, Alpha has 3 wins, Beta has 4 wins. Round 9: if Beta wins, Beta 5, Alpha 3. If Alpha wins, Alpha 4, Beta 4. But since it's the 9th round, total possible wins are up to 9, but with ties possible. However, the problem states \"Win the majority of fields to win the round!\" So each round, if you win two or more fields, you win the round. If it's a tie in fields (like 1-1-1), then it's a tie round, no one wins. But in the history, Round 1 was a tie (both same allocation, so each field tied, so 0-0-0, tie round). So the wins are only when a player wins two fields.\n\nSo after Round 8: Alpha has 3 round wins, Beta 4. Round 9 is the last. So Beta needs to win this round to have 5 total, which would be majority (since 5 out of 9). If Beta loses, Alpha gets to 4, Beta stays at 4, so 4-4-1 (one tie), but since it's best of 9, 4-4 would mean no clear winner? Wait, but the problem says \"Win two battlefields per round\" to win the round. So each round, either one player wins the round, or it's a tie. The total game is first to 5 round wins? Or after 9 rounds, whoever has more round wins. Since it's Round 9/9, it's a fixed 9 rounds. So final score after 9 rounds: whoever has more round wins. Current after 8 rounds: Alpha 3, Beta 4. So Round 9: if Beta wins, 5-3 Beta. If Alpha wins, 4-4. If tie round, 4-4-1.\n\nBut the user's goal is to output the allocation for Round 9. As Commander Beta, I want to maximize the chance of winning this round.\n\nLooking at previous moves to infer Alpha's strategy.\n\nLet's list Alpha's allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4\nRound 2: A10 B4 C6\nRound 3: A4 B10 C6\nRound 4: A9 B2 C9\nRound 5: A9 B2 C9 (same as Round 4)\nRound 6: A4 B8 C8\nRound 7: A8 B4 C8\nRound 8: A11 B4 C5\n\nBeta's allocations:\n\nRound 1: A8 B8 C4 (tie)\nRound 2: A9 B9 C2 (Alpha won: Alpha A10>Beta A9; Alpha B4<Beta B9; Alpha C6>Beta C2 → Alpha wins A and C, Beta wins B → Alpha has two wins, so Alpha wins round)\nWait, no: to win the round, you need to win two battlefields. So in Round 2:\n\nAlpha: A10, B4, C6\nBeta: A9, B9, C2\n\nCompare each field:\nA: Alpha 10 > Beta 9 → Alpha wins A\nB: Alpha 4 < Beta 9 → Beta wins B\nC: Alpha 6 > Beta 2 → Alpha wins C\nSo Alpha wins A and C → two fields, so Alpha wins the round. Correct.\n\nRound 3:\nAlpha: A4, B10, C6\nBeta: A7, B6, C7\nA: Beta 7 > Alpha 4 → Beta\nB: Alpha 10 > Beta 6 → Alpha\nC: Beta 7 > Alpha 6 → Beta\nBeta wins A and C → wins round.\n\nRound 4:\nAlpha: A9, B2, C9\nBeta: A7, B7, C6\nA: Alpha 9 > Beta7\nB: Beta7 > Alpha2\nC: Alpha9 > Beta6\nAlpha wins A and C → wins round.\n\nRound 5:\nAlpha: A9, B2, C9\nBeta: A10, B3, C7\nA: Beta10 > Alpha9\nB: Beta3 > Alpha2\nC: Alpha9 > Beta7\nBeta wins A and B → wins round.\n\nRound 6:\nAlpha: A4, B8, C8\nBeta: A7, B3, C10\nA: Beta7 > Alpha4\nB: Alpha8 > Beta3\nC: Beta10 > Alpha8\nBeta wins A and C → wins round.\n\nRound 7:\nAlpha: A8, B4, C8\nBeta: A7, B9, C4\nA: Alpha8 > Beta7\nB: Beta9 > Alpha4\nC: Alpha8 > Beta4\nAlpha wins A and C → wins round.\n\nRound 8:\nAlpha: A11, B4, C5\nBeta: A5, B5, C10\nA: Alpha11 > Beta5\nB: Beta5 > Alpha4\nC: Beta10 > Alpha5\nBeta wins B and C → wins round.\n\nNow, analyzing Alpha's pattern. Let's see the allocations:\n\nRound 1: balanced (8,8,4)\nRound 2: heavy A (10), light B (4), medium C (6)\nRound 3: light A (4), heavy B (10), medium C (6)\nRound 4: heavy A (9), light B (2), heavy C (9)\nRound 5: same as Round 4 (9,2,9)\nRound 6: light A (4), medium B (8), medium C (8)\nRound 7: medium A (8), light B (4), medium C (8)\nRound 8: very heavy A (11), light B (4), medium C (5)\n\nHmm. Alpha seems to sometimes focus on two fields, often making one very heavy (like A in Rounds 2,4,5,7,8) or B in Round 3.\n\nIn Round 8, Alpha went A11, which is quite high. In Round 7, A8. Round 4 and 5: A9. Round 2: A10.\n\nSo perhaps Alpha is favoring field A in many rounds. Let's count how many times Alpha put the highest number in each field:\n\nRound 1: A8, B8, C4 → highest in A and B (tied), but C is lowest. So maybe considered balanced.\nRound 2: A10 (highest), then C6, B4. So A is highest.\nRound 3: B10 (highest), then C6 and A4. So B highest.\nRound 4: A9 and C9 tied highest, B2 lowest.\nRound 5: same as 4.\nRound 6: B8 and C8 tied, A4 lowest.\nRound 7: A8 and C8 tied, B4 lowest.\nRound 8: A11 highest, then C5, B4.\n\nSo in Rounds 2,4,5,7,8: Alpha has A as one of the top fields (either highest or tied). In Round 3, B is highest. Round 6, B and C tied highest.\n\nAs Beta, in previous rounds, Beta tried different strategies. For example, in Round 8, Beta put C10 to counter Alpha's lower C (5). Which worked.\n\nFor Round 9, need to predict Alpha's move. Given that in recent rounds:\n\nRound 6: Alpha did A4, B8, C8\nRound 7: A8, B4, C8\nRound 8: A11, B4, C5\n\nSo Round 8 was a shift to very high A (11), low B (4), medium C (5). Maybe Alpha is varying but sometimes goes high on A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha is copying Beta's previous move? Let's see:\n\nAfter Round 1 (Beta: 8,8,4), Alpha did 10,4,6 in Round 2. Not sure.\n\nRound 2 Beta: 9,9,2; Alpha Round 3: 4,10,6.\n\nNot obvious.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in Alpha's allocations. Let's see the average per field:\n\nTotal allocations for Alpha over 8 rounds (excluding ties where it doesn't matter):\n\nA: 8+10+4+9+9+4+8+11 = let's calculate:\n\nRound1:8, R2:10, R3:4, R4:9, R5:9, R6:4, R7:8, R8:11.\n\nSum A: 8+10=18, +4=22, +9=31, +9=40, +4=44, +8=52, +11=63. Average A: 63/8 ≈7.875\n\nB: 8+4+10+2+2+8+4+4 → R1:8, R2:4, R3:10, R4:2, R5:2, R6:8, R7:4, R8:4.\n\nSum B: 8+4=12+10=22+2=24+2=26+8=34+4=38+4=42. Average B: 42/8=5.25\n\nC:4+6+6+9+9+8+8+5 → R1:4, R2:6, R3:6, R4:9, R5:9, R6:8, R7:8, R8:5.\n\nSum C:4+6=10+6=16+9=25+9=34+8=42+8=50+5=55. Average C:55/8≈6.875\n\nSo Alpha's average allocation: A≈7.88, B≈5.25, C≈6.88. So tends to put more in A and C, less in B.\n\nIn recent rounds (Rounds 6-8):\n\nR6: A4, B8, C8\nR7: A8, B4, C8\nR8: A11, B4, C5\n\nSo in R6, low A; R7 medium A; R8 high A. Maybe cycling?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Alpha is reacting to Beta's previous move.\n\nLet's see Beta's allocations:\n\nBeta Round1: 8,8,4\n\nAlpha Round2: 10,4,6 → Maybe Alpha saw Beta's high B (8), so Alpha went low B (4), high A (10), medium C (6).\n\nBeta Round2:9,9,2\n\nAlpha Round3:4,10,6 → Beta had high A and B (9,9), so Alpha went low A (4), high B (10), and medium C (6).\n\nBeta Round3:7,6,7\n\nAlpha Round4:9,2,9 → Beta had balanced (7,6,7), so Alpha went high A and C (9,9), low B (2).\n\nBeta Round4:7,7,6\n\nAlpha Round5:9,2,9 → same as Round4. Beta had A7,B7,C6, so Alpha again high A and C.\n\nBeta Round5:10,3,7\n\nAlpha Round6:4,8,8 → Beta had high A (10), low B (3), so Alpha went low A (4), high B and C (8,8).\n\nBeta Round6:7,3,10\n\nAlpha Round7:8,4,8 → Beta had A7,B3,C10. Alpha went medium A (8), low B (4), medium C (8).\n\nBeta Round7:7,9,4\n\nAlpha Round8:11,4,5 → Beta had high B (9), so Alpha went very high A (11), low B (4), and low C (5? Wait C was 5, which is medium).\n\nHmm, trying to find a pattern. It seems that Alpha often responds to Beta's previous allocation by putting more in the fields where Beta put less, or something like that.\n\nFor example:\n\nAfter Beta Round1 (8,8,4), Alpha Round2 (10,4,6): Beta had high A and B, so Alpha put high A (maybe not), but low B. Wait, Beta's B was 8, Alpha's B was 4. So Alpha went low B when Beta went high B.\n\nSimilarly, Beta Round2 (9,9,2): high A and B, low C. Alpha Round3 (4,10,6): low A, high B, medium C. Wait, Alpha went high B, but Beta had high B. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alpha is trying to win two fields by overbidding on two where Beta underbid.\n\nAnother approach: in Colonel Blotto, common strategies include splitting evenly, or focusing on two fields.\n\nGiven that Beta has been varying, but in the last few rounds:\n\nBeta Round6:7,3,10\n\nBeta Round7:7,9,4\n\nBeta Round8:5,5,10\n\nSo Round8 Beta went low A and B, high C.\n\nAlpha Round8:11,4,5. So Alpha went very high A (11), low B (4), and medium C (5). Beta had A5, so Alpha's 11 beat it; Beta B5 > Alpha 4; Beta C10 > Alpha 5. So Beta won B and C.\n\nFor Round9, if Alpha anticipates Beta might go high on C again (as in Round8), Alpha might lower C and raise A or B.\n\nBut as Beta, need to choose an allocation that beats likely Alpha moves.\n\nAlternatively, consider what Alpha might do based on previous responses.\n\nLooking at Beta's last move (Round8: A5 B5 C10), how would Alpha respond?\n\nIn previous rounds, when Beta had high C (Round8: C10), Alpha Round8 actually had C5, which was lower. Wait, no: Beta Round8 was response to Alpha Round7.\n\nWait, let's see the sequence:\n\nRound7:\nAlpha: A8 B4 C8\nBeta: A7 B9 C4 → Beta won B, lost A and C. Wait no, Round7 result was Alpha won. Because A: Alpha8>Beta7; B: Beta9>Alpha4; C: Alpha8>Beta4. So Alpha wins A and C.\n\nThen Round8:\n\nBeta chose A5 B5 C10.\n\nAlpha chose A11 B4 C5.\n\nSo Beta's strategy in Round8 was to abandon A (only 5), match B (5 vs Alpha's previous B4, but Alpha changed to B4 again?), and go high C (10). Which worked because Alpha put C5, so Beta's 10 won C, and B5 > Alpha B4, so Beta won B and C.\n\nNow, for Round9, Alpha might expect Beta to possibly go high on C again, or change tactics.\n\nIf Alpha thinks Beta will go high C again, Alpha might lower C and put more in A and B.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha might go for a balanced approach.\n\nBut given Alpha's history, in Round8 they went A11, which is quite high. Maybe they'll continue varying.\n\nWhat's a good strategy for Beta in the final round?\n\nSince it's the last round and Beta is leading 4-3, but needs to win this round to secure 5-3. If they lose, it's 4-4, which might not be a win (depending on rules, but the problem says \"Win the majority of fields to win the round\", and game is over 9 rounds. So if it's 4-4 after 9, maybe it's a tie, but the user is to output the action for Round9 regardless.\n\nBut assuming that Beta wants to maximize the chance to win Round9.\n\nLooking for an allocation that can beat likely Alpha allocations.\n\nCommon allocations in Blotto: sometimes people split 8-8-4, 9-9-2, 7-7-6, etc.\n\nBut given Alpha's tendency to go high on A sometimes, maybe Beta should consider underbidding A and focusing on B and C.\n\nFor example, if Beta does A4 B8 C8, then:\n\nIf Alpha goes high A (like 11), then Alpha wins A, but Beta needs to win B and C.\n\nBut Alpha might have lower B and C.\n\nWait, let's suppose Alpha might do something like A10 B3 C7 (similar to Beta's Round5), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the last few rounds, Alpha has been varying A from 4 to 11.\n\nAnother approach: look for a strategy that covers multiple possibilities.\n\nIn Colonel Blotto, a common tactic is to use a \"mirror\" strategy or to anticipate the opponent's move.\n\nAlternatively, since Beta has won the last two rounds (Round6 and 8; Round7 was loss), with Round8 being A5 B5 C10.\n\nIf Alpha thinks Beta will do something similar, maybe high C again, Alpha might reduce C and increase A or B.\n\nSo if Beta anticipates that, maybe Beta should avoid high C and go for something else.\n\nAlternatively, do a balanced 7-7-6, but let's check.\n\nWait, let's think of possible Alpha allocations and how to beat them.\n\nSuppose Alpha does A9 B2 C9 again (as in Rounds4 and 5). To beat that, Beta needs to win two fields. So either:\n\n- Beat A and B: so A>9, B>2. But A>9 would be at least 10, B>2 is 3+. Then C would be 20-10-3=7. But then C=7 <9, so Alpha wins C. So Beta wins A and B → wins round.\n\nOr beat A and C: A>9, C>9. So A≥10, C≥10, but 10+10=20, so B=0. Possible: A10 B0 C10. Then against A9 B2 C9: Beta wins A and C, wins round.\n\nOr beat B and C: B>2 and C>9. B≥3, C≥10. So B3 C10 A7. Which is what Beta did in Round6: A7 B3 C10, which worked against Alpha's A4 B8 C8. But in this hypothetical Alpha A9 B2 C9, Beta A7 would lose to A9, but B3 > B2 and C10 > C9: so Beta wins B and C, thus wins round.\n\nSo if Alpha repeats A9 B2 C9, Beta can win with A7 B3 C10.\n\nBut will Alpha repeat that?\n\nIn Round6, Alpha did A4 B8 C8. Round7: A8 B4 C8. Round8: A11 B4 C5.\n\nSo not repeating the same.\n\nAnother common Alpha move was heavy A: Round2 A10, Round4 A9, Round5 A9, Round7 A8, Round8 A11.\n\nSo maybe A is often high.\n\nIf Beta assumes Alpha will go high on A again, say A≥10, then Beta should not compete on A, and focus on B and C.\n\nSo allocate minimum to A (like 0-3), and split the rest to B and C such that both are high enough to beat likely Alpha allocations.\n\nFor example, if Beta does A3 B9 C8.\n\nBut need to ensure B and C are sufficiently high.\n\nWhat's Alpha's typical B and C when A is high?\n\nIn Round2: A10, so B4 C6\n\nRound4: A9, B2 C9\n\nRound5: same as 4\n\nRound7: A8, B4 C8\n\nRound8: A11, B4 C5\n\nSo when Alpha goes high A (≥8), B is often low (2,4), and C varies (5,6,8,9).\n\nSo if Alpha does A≥10, B is likely 2-4, C is medium.\n\nSo Beta could do A low (say 2-4), B≥5, C≥7.\n\nFor example, A4 B8 C8.\n\nCheck against possible Alpha moves:\n\nIf Alpha does A10 B4 C6 (like Round2):\n\nBeta A4 < A10 → Alpha wins A\n\nBeta B8 > B4 → Beta wins B\n\nBeta C8 > C6 → Beta wins C\n\nSo Beta wins B and C → wins round.\n\nIf Alpha does A9 B2 C9 (Rounds4,5):\n\nBeta A4 <9 → Alpha A\n\nBeta B8 >2 → Beta B\n\nBeta C8 <9 → Alpha C\n\nSo Alpha wins A and C, Beta wins B → Alpha wins round. Not good.\n\nAh, so if Alpha does A9 B2 C9, Beta's A4 B8 C8 would lose.\n\nAlternative: Beta does A3 B7 C10.\n\nAgainst A9 B2 C9:\n\nA: 3<9 → Alpha\n\nB:7>2 → Beta\n\nC:10>9 → Beta\n\nSo Beta wins B and C → wins round.\n\nAgainst A10 B4 C6:\n\nA:3<10\n\nB:7>4\n\nC:10>6\n\nBeta wins B and C.\n\nAgainst A11 B4 C5:\n\nA:3<11\n\nB:7>4\n\nC:10>5\n\nBeta wins B and C.\n\nGood.\n\nWhat if Alpha does something else, like Round6: A4 B8 C8.\n\nBeta A3 B7 C10 vs Alpha A4 B8 C8:\n\nA:3<4 → Alpha\n\nB:7<8 → Alpha\n\nC:10>8 → Beta\n\nSo Alpha wins A and B, Beta wins C → Alpha wins round.\n\nNot good. So if Alpha decides to go low A, then Beta's strategy fails.\n\nSo need a more robust strategy.\n\nAlternative approach: since the game is symmetric and zero-sum, perhaps the optimal strategy is to randomize, but since this is a single round and we have history, try to anticipate.\n\nAnother angle: in the last round, both players know it's the final, so may go for broke.\n\nBut Beta is ahead, so maybe Alpha will take a risk.\n\nLooking at all Alpha's moves, the minimum they've put in any field:\n\nA: min 4 (R3,R6)\n\nB: min 2 (R4,R5)\n\nC: min 4 (R1,R7,R8) Wait, Round1 C4, Round8 C5, others higher. So min C is 4.\n\nWait, Round1 C4, Round2 C6, Round3 C6, Round4 C9, Round5 C9, Round6 C8, Round7 C8, Round8 C5. So minimum C is 4 (Round1).\n\nBut Round1 was a tie.\n\nSo possible Alpha might go C4 again.\n\nIf Beta allocates to beat common possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: use the fact that in order to win two fields, the allocations often have two fields with at least 7 or so.\n\nWait, but with 20 troops, possible splits like 9-9-2, 8-8-4, 7-7-6, 10-7-3, etc.\n\nIf Beta chooses 7-7-6, let's see:\n\nAgainst Alpha's Round8 (11,4,5): 7<11, 7>4, 6>5 → Beta wins B and C, wins round.\n\nAgainst Round7 (8,4,8): 7<8, 7>4, 6<8 → Beta only wins B, loses round.\n\nNot good.\n\nWhat about 6-7-7:\n\nSimilar issue.\n\nHow about 5-8-7:\n\nAgainst Round8 (11,4,5): 5<11, 8>4, 7>5 → wins B and C.\n\nAgainst Round7 (8,4,8): 5<8, 8>4, 7<8 → only B, loses.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, go for A=0. But allocations must be ≥0, so possible.\n\nA0 B10 C10.\n\nCheck against:\n\nAlpha Round8 (11,4,5): A0<11, B10>4, C10>5 → wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round4 (9,2,9): A0<9, B10>2, C10>9 → wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round2 (10,4,6): same, wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round7 (8,4,8): A0<8, B10>4, C10>8 → wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round3 (4,10,6): A0<4, B10=10 (tie?), wait no: troops are exact. If both same, it's a tie for that field. But to win a field, need strictly more.\n\nSo Alpha B10 vs Beta B10: tie. So in that case:\n\nAlpha A4, B10, C6\n\nBeta A0, B10, C10\n\nA: Alpha 4 > Beta 0\n\nB: tie\n\nC: Beta 10 > Alpha 6\n\nSo only C win for Beta, so Alpha wins A, Beta wins C, B tie → no majority, so tie round. Which would result in no win, keeping score 4-4.\n\nBut Beta wants to avoid that. So A0 B10 C10 is risky if Alpha does high B.\n\nWhen did Alpha have high B? Round3: B10.\n\nSo if Alpha does B10 again, this strategy fails.\n\nBut how likely is Alpha to repeat B10?\n\nAlpha's B allocations: 8,4,10,2,2,8,4,4. So B10 only in Round3. So maybe not common.\n\nAnother option: A2 B9 C9.\n\nCheck against common Alpha moves.\n\nAlpha Round8 (11,4,5): A2<11, B9>4, C9>5 → wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round4 (9,2,9): A2<9, B9>2, C9=9 → tie C. So Beta wins B only, Alpha wins A. Tie round? No majority. So Alpha A, Beta B, tie C → no winner. Not good.\n\nSo need C to be at least 10 to beat Alpha's C9.\n\nThus, A1 B9 C10.\n\nCheck:\n\nAgainst Alpha A9 B2 C9: A1<9, B9>2, C10>9 → Beta wins B and C.\n\nAgainst Alpha A11 B4 C5: same as above.\n\nAgainst Alpha A4 B10 C6 (Round3): A1<4, B9<10, C10>6 → only C win, so loses.\n\nBut Alpha B10 only once.\n\nAnother possible allocation: A3 B8 C9.\n\nAgainst A9 B2 C9: A3<9, B8>2, C9=C9 tie. So Beta wins B only. Alpha wins A. Tie C. So no majority, tie round.\n\nNot good.\n\nA3 B7 C10:\n\nAs before, works against many, but fails if Alpha has high B.\n\nBut given Alpha's B is usually low when A is high.\n\nWait, in Round3 when Alpha had high B (10), A was low (4). So if Alpha does high B, A is likely low.\n\nSo if Beta does A3 B7 C10, and Alpha does high B (like B10), then likely A is low (e.g., 4), so:\n\nAlpha A4 B10 C6\n\nBeta A3 B7 C10\n\nA: Alpha 4 > Beta3\n\nB: Alpha10 > Beta7\n\nC: Beta10 > Alpha6\n\nSo Alpha wins A and B, Beta wins C → Alpha wins round.\n\nBut Beta loses in that case.\n\nHowever, how likely is Alpha to do high B again? Only once in 8 rounds.\n\nAlternatively, the risk might be worth it.\n\nAnother angle: Beta's previous winning allocations.\n\nBeta won Rounds3,5,6,8.\n\nRound3: A7 B6 C7 vs Alpha A4 B10 C6 → won A and C.\n\nRound5: A10 B3 C7 vs Alpha A9 B2 C9 → won A and B.\n\nRound6: A7 B3 C10 vs Alpha A4 B8 C8 → won A and C.\n\nRound8: A5 B5 C10 vs Alpha A11 B4 C5 → won B and C.\n\nSo common in winning rounds: often winning two fields with allocations like medium A, low B, high C or similar.\n\nIn Round8, won with low A, medium B, high C.\n\nPerhaps for Round9, continuing with high C could be good, assuming Alpha might not expect it again.\n\nBut in Round8, Beta did C10, and Alpha's C was 5, so it worked.\n\nIf Beta does C10 again, Alpha might increase C.\n\nBut how much can Alpha allocate to C? If Alpha puts, say, C8, then Beta C10 would still win.\n\nUnless Alpha goes C11 or something.\n\nBut with 20 troops, if Alpha wants to beat C10, needs at least 11 in C, leaving 9 for A and B.\n\nFor example, Alpha A5 B4 C11.\n\nThen if Beta does A5 B5 C10:\n\nA: Alpha5 vs Beta5 tie\n\nB: Alpha4 < Beta5\n\nC: Alpha11 > Beta10\n\nSo Beta wins B only, Alpha wins C, tie A → no majority.\n\nNot good for Beta.\n\nAlternatively, if Beta does A4 B6 C10:\n\nAgainst Alpha A5 B4 C11:\n\nA:4<5\n\nB:6>4\n\nC:10<11\n\nSo Alpha wins A and C, Beta wins B → Alpha wins.\n\nSo to beat a high C Alpha, Beta would need C≥11, but then allocations become tight.\n\nPerhaps safer to not go extremely high on C.\n\nAnother idea: the median of Alpha's allocations.\n\nFor field A: sorted Alpha's A: 4,4,8,8,9,9,10,11 → median between 8 and 9, say 8.5.\n\nSimilarly B: 2,2,4,4,4,8,8,10 → median 4.\n\nC:4,5,6,6,8,8,9,9 → median 7.\n\nSo if Beta allocates slightly above median: A9, B5, C6. But 9+5+6=20.\n\nCheck:\n\nA9 would beat Alpha's A if Alpha has ≤8.\n\nFrom Alpha's A allocations: 4,4,8,8,9,9,10,11. So A9 would beat the two 8s and the 4s, but lose to 9,10,11.\n\nIn Round4 and 5, Alpha had A9, so tie; Rounds7 A8, so Beta A9 would win.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nPerhaps better to go for two fields where Alpha is likely weak.\n\nGiven Alpha's B is often low (min 2), and C is sometimes medium.\n\nIf Beta does A=5 (moderate), B=8, C=7.\n\nCheck against recent Alpha:\n\nRound8: A11 B4 C5 → Beta A5 <11, B8>4, C7>5 → wins B and C.\n\nRound7: A8 B4 C8 → A5<8, B8>4, C7<8 → wins B only, loses.\n\nNot good.\n\nA6 B8 C6.\n\nRound8: A6<11, B8>4, C6>5 → wins B and C.\n\nRound7: A6<8, B8>4, C6<8 → wins B only.\n\nSame issue.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternative strategy: since in the last round Alpha might try to mirror Beta's previous move.\n\nBeta's last move was A5 B5 C10.\n\nIf Alpha mirrors or adjusts, maybe Alpha does A10 B5 C5 or something.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nIf Beta chooses A8 B8 C4 (like Round1), let's see:\n\nAgainst Round8 Alpha (11,4,5): A8<11, B8>4, C4<5 → wins B only.\n\nLoses.\n\nNot good.\n\nWait, what if Beta goes A9 B9 C2.\n\nBut in Round2, that lost to Alpha's A10 B4 C6.\n\nIf Alpha does similar, would lose again.\n\nNot advisable.\n\nAnother angle: the sum of two fields. Since you need to win two, perhaps allocate so that two fields sum to more than likely Alpha's.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nWait, think of possible Alpha's common allocations.\n\nFrom history, Alpha has done:\n\n- High A, low B, high C: (9,2,9) twice\n\n- High A, low B, medium C: (10,4,6), (11,4,5), (8,4,8)\n\n- Low A, high B, medium C: (4,10,6)\n\n- Low A, medium B and C: (4,8,8)\n\nSo perhaps the most common is high A with low B.\n\nIf Beta assumes Alpha will do high A (≥9) and low B (≤4), then:\n\nBeta should allocate min to A (≤8), enough to B to beat 4 (so ≥5), and the rest to C.\n\nFor example, A=7, B=5, C=8. Total 20.\n\nCheck:\n\nAgainst A9 B2 C9: A7<9, B5>2, C8<9 → wins B only, loses.\n\nNot good. Need C≥10.\n\nA=6, B=5, C=9.\n\nAgainst A9 B2 C9: A6<9, B5>2, C9=C9 tie. Wins B only.\n\nA=5, B=5, C=10. Which is what Beta did in Round8.\n\nAnd it worked against Round8 Alpha (11,4,5): won B and C.\n\nIf Alpha repeats a similar move, it would work.\n\nBut if Alpha changes, say does A=7 B=7 C=6.\n\nBeta A5 B5 C10 vs Alpha A7 B7 C6:\n\nA:5<7\n\nB:5<7\n\nC:10>6\n\nOnly C win, loses.\n\nBut how likely is Alpha to do balanced?\n\nAlpha's most balanced was Round1:8,8,4.\n\nBut that was first round.\n\nConsidering all this, perhaps the safest is to go with a allocation that worked recently, like Round8: A5 B5 C10.\n\nBut might be predictable.\n\nAlternatively, tweak it: A4 B6 C10.\n\nStill totals 20.\n\nCheck against possible:\n\nAlpha Round8 style (A11 B4 C5): A4<11, B6>4, C10>5 → wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round4 style (A9 B2 C9): A4<9, B6>2, C10>9 → wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round3 style (A4 B10 C6): A4=4 tie, B6<10, C10>6 → wins C only. Tie on A. So Alpha wins B, Beta wins C, tie A: no majority, tie round. Not ideal, but better than losing.\n\nAlpha Round6 style (A4 B8 C8): A4=4 tie, B6<8, C10>8 → wins C only. Same issue.\n\nBut given that Alpha has only done high B once, maybe acceptable.\n\nAnother option: A3 B7 C10.\n\nAs discussed earlier.\n\nOr A2 B8 C10.\n\nA2 B8 C10.\n\nAgainst A9 B2 C9: win B and C.\n\nAgainst A11 B4 C5: win B and C.\n\nAgainst A4 B10 C6: lose B, win C; A loss. Only one win.\n\nBut probability of Alpha high B is low.\n\nGiven that in 8 rounds, only one instance of B≥8 (Round3 B10, Round6 B8).\n\nSo maybe 2 out of 8, so 25% chance.\n\nIf Beta chooses A2 B8 C10, they lose if Alpha does high B, but win otherwise.\n\nSince it's the final round and Beta needs to win, taking a risk might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, balance more.\n\nWait, another idea: since to win two fields, the minimal winning allocations could be like 7-7-6.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIf Beta does A7 B7 C6.\n\nCheck against:\n\nAlpha Round8 (11,4,5): A7<11, B7>4, C6>5 → wins B and C.\n\nAlpha Round4 (9,2,9): A7<9, B7>2, C6<9 → wins B only.\n\nSo loses.\n\nNot good.\n\nA8 B7 C5.\n\nAgainst Round4: A8<9, B7>2, C5<9 → wins B only.\n\nSame issue.\n\nHmm.\n\nBack to A3 B7 C10.\n\nIt covers many cases.\n\nLet's verify against all Alpha's past allocations to see how many it would have won.\n\nBeta hypothetical: A3 B7 C10.\n\nAgainst each Alpha round:\n\nRound1: Alpha 8,8,4\n\nA:3<8, B:7<8, C:10>4 → only C win. Lose.\n\nRound2: Alpha10,4,6\n\nA:3<10, B:7>4, C:10>6 → wins B and C. Win.\n\nRound3: Alpha4,10,6\n\nA:3<4, B:7<10, C:10>6 → only C. Lose.\n\nRound4: Alpha9,2,9\n\nA:3<9, B:7>2, C:10>9 → wins B and C. Win.\n\nRound5: same as 4 → Win.\n\nRound6: Alpha4,8,8\n\nA:3<4, B:7<8, C:10>8 → only C. Lose.\n\nRound7: Alpha8,4,8\n\nA:3<8, B:7>4, C:10>8 → wins B and C. Win.\n\nRound8: Alpha11,4,5\n\nA:3<11, B:7>4, C:10>5 → wins B and C. Win.\n\nSo out of 8 rounds, this allocation would have won Rounds2,4,5,7,8 → 5 wins. Only lost Rounds1,3,6.\n\nGiven that Alpha's recent rounds (4-8) it would have won 4 out of 5 (lost Round6), it's a strong allocation.\n\nWhereas Beta's actual allocations won 4 rounds (3,5,6,8).\n\nSo A3 B7 C10 seems better historically.\n\nAnother check: Round6 Alpha was 4,8,8.\n\nBeta A3 B7 C10 loses because B7 <8.\n\nBut if Beta increases B to 8: A2 B8 C10.\n\nCheck Round6: A2<4, B8=8 tie, C10>8. So C win, tie B. So only one win (C), and tie B. To win the round need two fields. So no, still only one win. Unless tie counts as half, but no: must win two outright.\n\nSo in Round6 with Alpha B8, Beta B8 ties, so no win there.\n\nThus, to beat Round6's Alpha, Beta would need B≥9.\n\nBut then allocation becomes A=1 B9 C10.\n\nCheck against Round6: A1<4, B9>8, C10>8 → wins B and C. Good.\n\nAgainst Round4: A1<9, B9>2, C10>9 → wins B and C.\n\nAgainst Round8: same as before.\n\nAgainst Round3: Alpha A4 B10 C6.\n\nA1<4, B9<10, C10>6 → only C. Lose.\n\nSo A1 B9 C10 would lose only when Alpha has B≥10.\n\nWhich happened once.\n\nThis allocation:\n\n- Wins against Rounds2,4,5,6,7,8 (all where B≤8 or C≤9)\n\n- Loses to Round3 (B10)\n\n- Round1: Alpha8,8,4. A1<8, B9>8, C10>4 → wins B and C. So actually wins Round1 too.\n\nWait:\n\nRound1 Alpha:8,8,4\n\nBeta A1 B9 C10:\n\nA:1<8 → Alpha\n\nB:9>8 → Beta\n\nC:10>4 → Beta\n\nBeta wins B and C → wins round. Yes.\n\nRound3 Alpha:4,10,6\n\nA:1<4, B:9<10, C:10>6 → only C. Lose.\n\nSo out of 8 rounds, would win 7, lose 1 (Round3).\n\nThat's very strong.\n\nWhy didn't Beta use this before?\n\nBecause it's risky if Alpha goes high B.\n\nBut given Alpha only did B10 once in 8 rounds, it's a good bet.\n\nFor Round9, if Beta uses A1 B9 C10, it would likely win unless Alpha does B≥10.\n\nGiven Alpha's B allocations: mostly low, with only one instance of B=10 and one B=8.\n\nIf Alpha is rational, they might realize that Beta is likely to underbid A and go high B and C.\n\nBut since it's the final round, hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, Alpha might go for an unexpected balanced allocation.\n\nBut statistically, A1 B9 C10 seems strong.\n\nLet's confirm the sum:1+9+10=20. Correct.\n\nAnother option: A0 B10 C10, but as discussed earlier, if Alpha does B=10, it ties and may not win.\n\nA1 B9 C10 avoids tying B at 10.\n\nGiven all this, I think A1 B9 C10 is a solid choice.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's an even better allocation.\n\nWhat about A2 B8 C10.\n\nSum=20.\n\nAgainst Round3 Alpha B10: B8<10, so lose B.\n\nBut against Round6 Alpha B8: tie B, so not winning outright.\n\nWhereas A1 B9 C10 beats Round6.\n\nYes, B9 >8.\n\nSo A1 B9 C10 is better.\n\nAnother test: what if Alpha does B=9.\n\nSay Alpha A10 B9 C1.\n\nBeta A1 B9 C10:\n\nA:1<10\n\nB:9=9 tie\n\nC:10>1\n\nOnly C win. Tie round. Not good.\n\nBut how likely is Alpha to do B=9?\n\nAlpha's B allocations never went to 9. Max was 10, then 8.\n\nSo unlikely.\n\nThus, A1 B9 C10 seems a good gamble.\n\nAlternatively, to cover against B=9, do B=10.\n\nA0 B10 C10.\n\nBut then if Alpha does B=10, tie.\n\nBut as mentioned, only Round3 had B=10.\n\nGiven that, and in the final round, going A1 B9 C10 maximizes wins against historical data.\n\nTherefore, I think the optimal play is [A1 B9 C10].\n",
